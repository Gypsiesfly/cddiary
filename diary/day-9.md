# "As a leader, learn how to lie"

I woke up by 12am confused, down and angry, everyone in the hostel was asleep and i wondered how the platoon would continue after failing 4 good times, my eyes were swollen from the tears stuck in them and I wandered to the bathroom so I'd have a bath.

We had lost Men's football, Ankara competition, Girls Volleyball and Karaoke something has to change, as I got into the bathroom there was no window in it so I could look outside, my mind was far away, I really wondered if we could come back from this, because I felt weak and if I felt weak, how would the rest of the Platoon feel.

As I stared into the open darkness, like a careless whisper carried by the wind, I heard it

"Lie"

"Lie to yourself" I heard it again

I realized, that to get past this barrage of failures, I have to lie, I have to lie to myself, I have to lie so much until I believe the lie then force the Platoon members to believe the lie

What was the lie?, what lie would I tell everyone that would lift their spirits and lift mine also after thinking for a while it hit me.

And I rose my head in realization, Jackpot!

Parade time came and they gave the platoon a chance for announcements, Mrs Eneda would tell everyone to form a circle so the people dropping the announcements would talk inside the circle, i walked through the crowd with a confidence that I could feel oozing out from me and with my head held high (but I was kinda shy because of the karaoke failure last night), I made my way to the inner circle where Mrs Eneda was dropping announcements while the rest of the platoon made noise

"So you guys don't want to participate in anything eh?" she said

"You made your platoon leader come out for karaoke yesterday!"

"Platoon leader, anything?" she asked as she turned towards me

"yes, I have an announcement"

"Everyone listen up!" she said but the platoon members still made noise and we couldn't even hear ourselves properly, the former me would have tried to shout at them to keep quiet, but this new me was different, remember the big giant guy from the platoon? The one that hid during the Platoon leader votes and also was a flag bearer? That dude.

I gave him a look and he knew what to do

"Everybody shut up!" His voice echoed through the crowd and the circle went silent

I walked quietly to the middle of the circle with my eyes focused

Now here's the lie

I looked round the circle

"platoon 6 has had a rough start, we've failed a lot"

"But not this platoon 6!" My face squeezed in seriousness as I cooked this lie

"This is a new day, which means this is a new Platoon 6!"

"And this Platoon 6…has not failed yet!" I screamed and the Platoon went loud with cheers and acknowledgement

"Today we are having debate this morning in the hall, Ore, Elijah and prosper will be handling it" I said as I dragged Elijah out from the crowd to the inner circle

Elijah was the 1st class dude that became Debate director, and we stood out there and lied to everyone that we'd win the debate.

We won the debate.

How?

Sophie and some other guy represented platoon 9 while Ore and prosper represented Platoon 6

The debate topic was "Mentoring secondary school Leavers (NEFT) in your host community; A CALL TO LEADERSHIP"

I had told Ore a few points and she looked at me like I was disturbing her and she was bored.

Ore is another interesting Platoon 6 member, she was short, light skin and pretty too and wore some large spectacles, but she always wore a bitch face, like she was saying "don't talk to me" but I being the stubborn nigga that I am, I went to talk to her and as soon as I told her she had a bitch face she beamed up with a smile that I didn't think she had in her and PS she's stubborn as hell and also in the campus police (And the giant dude that I told you about was always with her, I think he likes her).

Now who is prosper, prosper was basically the platoon clown, he was Muslim but you wouldn't even know if he didn't tell you (I think he likes the tall girl that I told you looked like a model, Joy shes our hot-hand in Volleyball) I didn't see him as the smart person that should handle the debate but…Elijah the debate director told me to not judge the book by the cover so I let it happen.

And we won.

Sophie's platoon made one mistake, they let the guy that was to debate with her go second and after Sophie said a lot of smart stuff and gave them points but the guy came and spouted rubbish and stammered his ass out and made the lose points, but platoon 6? Prosper went first and to my surprise he wasn't too bad he just stammered and was scared but overall he was okay, but come in Ore, Ore went out there and commanded and screamed and pointed on NYSC members sleeping with people they're supposed to be teaching and so on and when she was done, I knew we had done something special, I wasn't expecting a first place but I hoped for first to third place.

"Third place goes to….Platoon 9!" shouted the announcer and the platoon 9 members screamed out loud in the hall while I could see Sophie use her paper to hit her face in annoyance (she's a perfectionist)

"Second place goes to Platoon 4", Platoon 4 members led by Pius stood up and shouted and cheered noisily, that noisy nigga.

By this time I just rested my head in defeat thinking we had lost again.

"And first place goes to….Platoon 6!"

I rose to my feet, raising up my index finger like Martin Luther king when he made "I have a dream" statements, I caught the eyes of Elijah and Ore in the front of the hall.

I hugged Ore and Prosper and Platoon 6 gathered outside to cheer for our first win

An announcement that people can start applying to fill their relocation forms was made and my heart skipped. Sophie!

I also saw the law students as they were leaving the camp, remember? The ones that had their Call to bar and couldn't leave the camp unless they decamped, I watched them leave and I wished them good luck.

A married woman from platoon 6 that was rushed to the hospital asked Mrs Eneda to send me to fill her relocation form for her, I ran from the main hall to Queen of the nights shop because the only cybercafe that existed in the camp was her neighbor.

While going for dinner, Sophie told me

"Your crushes said I should say hi to you"

"crushes ke" I replied

"yeah, you don't know you're popular in girls hostel now"

"after your performance yesterday" she added

"huh?"

She was talking about the karaoke where I sang I want it that way by The backstreet boys

"tf?"

Why the fuck would they like me because of that??

"One really wants me to introduce the both of you"

"They've been disturbing me and asking about you since yesterday night" she added

And as we were walking another girl stopped her on the way and they talked, she was chubby and cute but throughout her conversation with Sophie, her eyes did not leave my face, it was like she was undressing me with her eyes; so I knew she was one of the people Sophie was talking about.

I was a little upset that Sophie was trying to act as Cupid for me, I don't know why I was upset but I know I was upset.

Sophie got frustrated as told her about the relocation form availability just an hour until it was to stop, she said she hadn't heard about it and I had to help her get done with it since I had done it for the married woman, we both ran to the cybercafe then only I made it back to submit before the woman left, we were 5 minutes late but she saw I was a platoon leader and let me, the the woman frowned so much that if you saw her outside you'd be scared to speak to her.

I was panting when Sophie walked in panting too

"Have you--have you submitted it?"

"Yeah" I replied as I collapsed on the chair, she collapsed on the chair right beside mine and rested her head on my shoulder and I rested mine on her head, I enjoyed the scent of her hair cream and the scent of her as we both calmed ourselves together, we did it, we successfully submitted her relocation form.

Tonight's competition is cultural dance, Social director Sandy was going to organize it but when I went to Platoon 9's practise spot, I didn't hear a cultural song, I heard a Fela song, The white haired dude THAT WAS WITH Sophie was leading in partnership with Sophie and whenever those two do anything, it ends up being a very Avant-garde presentation, as soon as they noticed me, Sophie and the other girl that competed for the Ankara competition came to drag me away.

At dinner with Sophie while we were waiting for her soup to get served at Mami Market (For some reason she was popular among some shop folks)

"My Platoon won today, aren't you going to congratulate me?" I said as I walked closer to her slowly closing the space between us; slowly a smile formed on her face as she looked up at me, my eyes were locked in on her and everything was happening around me but it was only her I saw

"congratulations" she said

As she walked closer to me, till I could scent her hair cream and perfume; the silence made everything almost perfect

"We'll beat your platoon today tho" she said as she pushed me away, I laughed, sandy people let your cultural dance performance be something great, lets beat them!

Yo, you won't believe wtf just happened, so the competition came and Platoon 6's cultural dance was terrible and boring, nothing serious to show for it, platoon 5 on the other hand had two people backflip in the cultural dance and the crowd went wild.

Platoon 9 on the other hand…oh it was a spectacle!

The drummer came out alone with the singers and they started singing "Animal in human skin" and clapping with drums and no dancers, the noisy crowd fell silent and focused, even I locked in to see what stupid Avant-garde shit this niggas were about to do-- in a few seconds, Victor (The white haired nigga, the one that had been with Sophie I found out today his name is victor) this nigga stormed into the staged as fast as a rat and back-flipped, the crowd went bunkers! Then ran back inside the main hall again, then ran out again and back flipped again as the crowd of watching corp members increased their screaming volume.

I stood up and put my hands on my head in awe, I had counted 5 platoons that did spectacular performances in the cultural dance and platoon 6 was not one of them; this was the qualifying round for cultural dance and only 5 platoons would make it and after the performance by Platoon 9 and Victor, I was sure that we (platoon 6) didn't qualify.

Victor finished his presentation and platoon 10 finished theirs then it was time for the announcement; I stood up and started walking away in defeat but what I heard next from the judges shocked me

There are two main judges, one lady that behaves like a big baby but she's a little bit nice and another that's strict as hell and wears big red Harry-potter like googles

The Harry potter lady came to the stage and took the microphone

"I have told you people, I warned you people times without number!"

"No twerking! And NO STUNTS!"

"So if you know you did any flips on this stage! Just know your disqualified!" she finally exhaled after and continued

"i will now call the names of the qualifying platoons"

"Platoon 1, Platoon 3, Platoon 4, Platoon 10 and Platoon 6!" I turned to look at the stage in shock and Platoon 6 members ran to come and shake and hug me but this was way too shocking.

I searched for Victor and Sophie with my eyes and didn't find them, Sophie later showed up after the competition had ended, she was angry, I had never seen her angry side so it was intriguing to me, she might have as well wanted to fight the harry potter lady, I wanted to celebrate my victory but I couldn't because she was really angry.

That's another win for Platoon 6, tomorrow is drama so lets see how that goes, Goodnight folks.
