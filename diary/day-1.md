# Day 1 - "Hey, I have arrived"

It was finally the 16th of February and this is the day I am to report to the NYSC camp.

Lying Close to me was one of the most beautiful women in my life, Dee, I had invited Dee over to spend the night the day before for a few reasons
1. I was going to miss her
2. I liked her
3. I wanted to have sex one last time so I wouldn't want to sleep with anyone in camp.
4. Having her by me made me feel calm, like everything was okay

She had a class this morning so I had to cook up something for her and bolt her to school.

In no time she was in the bolt and I had to start packing my box, yes, I had not packed at all.
I had been unable to get my white shorts but I was ready. If this was any other family maybe I would've left home already and started my journey, but this is my family, and my parents were returning back home from their travels today.

If my dad sees anything wrong with the house when he returns, he was going to call me back from wherever I am to come home and fix it doesn't matter if I'm in mars, he'll tell me to start coming home, wouldn't tell you the reason why and you'd be journeying home in confusion trying to guess what you did wrong.

I went and got 3 white shirts for the NYSC white and it was way more expensive than what I had written but, I didn't want to dwell on that.

Spent hours printing documents, had to make 6 copies of each to avoid stories.

Just as I was about to leave the cybercafe, I received a message from my mother asking if I've left yet that THEY ARE CLOSE, close? Close??? ain't no way my parents arrive in Portharcourt and see me at home, that means I won't be travelling anymore.

As soon as I got that message I packed my documents into my bag and started running home to quickly travel, while running I replied with "I'm on my way out" ran home, arranged my box and my bag, crosschecked through my to-do's and the list of things I was to carry to travel and as they were complete, boarded a cab and was on my way to the bus park.

Luckily the bus was almost full and I was the last passenger, I joined up and we were on our way.

The ride was not anything special, I had no idea where I was going, what was going to happen or whatever, but I was excited, excited for something new, a new experience, new friends maybe, I'm not a really friendly person but I would like to make some friends, I also wanted to have a smooth NYSC, no too much drama, just quietly go in and come out.

In like an hour and thirty minutes we had arrived, I passed through a nice road, with faces of people painted on the walls, the roads seemed busy but not busy at the same time, I had no idea where I was going to so I had to ask the driver.

He said he was going to drop me at the park with his colleague so he would take me straight to the NYSC place, after a few minutes he dropped me with this fat looking man who started welcoming me to the state, seems like I was the first one on the bus and had to wait for it to be full, I was super scared but excited while in the bus, I saw a lady in full NYSC uniform and had to ask her if she knew the location of the camp, she seemed offended I asked and I apologized

"I'm headed to camp, so I don't really know where I'm going" I added

"i relocated here, so I don't really know much too" she responded

"but just remember, try to relax a little and be on the lookout, if you're stranded, find a police station and spend the night, its safer" she added

I nodded at her as the bus went into full throttle.

The ride took about 30 minutes and I was dropped at a road where I had to take a keke, a keke man quickly runs to carry my load saying "one chance" and it was already dark, so I was scared so I quickly joined him in the front seat after confirming that my load was safely in the back.

The back seat was filled with 3 old women, they were all really nice, I also have noticed, Imo state elders are nice people, that's crazy.

As the journey continued I couldn't fail to notice the foul smell coming from the driver, It was so strong that even the wind from the keke storming on couldn't quench it. The roads on this journey was like climbing a mountain and going down from it, and this nigga was speeding through it all, I was scared he was going to get us in an accident.

We finally arrived at the destination that would take me to the Imo state NYSC camp, I boarded a bike(okada) and was about to leave when kids about my younger sisters age ran towards the bike holding buckets and bailers, saying I was going to need them at camp, and I knew I needed them so I bought them and continued the journey, it took another 10 minutes and finally.

I first laid eyes on this long fence with forests surrounding it, the smell of green grass mixed with dust and we approached the gates, I paid off the bike man and rolled my suitcase in one hand, my bucket in the other, my bag on my back. Reminded me of my boarding school days, the feeling of nostalgia, don't worry, i'll write about them in College diary #Blue #Red and #Green respectfully.

As I passed through the gates it was already 8pm, by my left a few officers were seated

"ace, come here" my heart skipped

"open your box" he said

I dropped my suitcase on the chair and proceeded to find my keys to open the locks, I was shaking because, army and military people have done very bad things to youths outside and they have a reputation of hostility and I wasn't ready to let my first night be such.

Luckily, he was a nice guy, asked if I had drugs and I told him all I had was my malaria drugs, he took a look at them and let me proceed to a particular line where I noticed they were giving out papers

"Call up letter and SchOOL ID please?" an elderly man who frowned like he wasn't getting paid for his job asked, it wasn't my turn yet but I was scared, because to collect your certificate in PIROT(my University), you had to submit your school ID, all I had was a shabby white and black printout of it, while I was panicking I heard

"Oga, where is your documents" I froze, it was my turn! This man shoved me to the right

"go and sort your documents and come back"

I brought out my shabby printed school ID and my call up letter and proceeded to get back into the line, and right there, a miracle happened, the man didn't even look at my papers, just gave me the entry pass and let me in.

In no time I had gotten a room (room 3) I proceeded and got a nice bed and as I'm writing this, I'm about to go to bed, I was one of the first people to get in soâ€¦yeah, goodnight. Wait! I've got to text my dad

"Hey, I have arrived"
