# "Cook nigga, cook!"

Today is what I would call crazy, I woke up to one of
the most crazy news so far.

Sandy had fainted in the hostel.

I'm talking about the Sandy who's social director
that I wanted to remove and I was sure was going to
split the platoon in half, she fainted in the hostel
last night.

As Miriam finished telling me at the morning platoon
parade, I stood confused

"What could be the reason?"

"why did she faint?"

"I think its stress, the stress from all the competitions
might have gotten to her" said Joy as she came to
join in the huddle telling me about the incident

"I'll go see her after parade" I said

I went to see Sandy after the parade at the sick bay,
I took an apple with me; I've always believed that AN
APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY, does it work?
Idk but I haven't been sick so far and I eat apples
everyday.

I've also been buying apples for Sophie everyday since
the day we met, I don't want her to get sick and have
to go home and leave me alone here.

"You can go in" said the nurse

I walked in to see Sandy looking sick, my energetic
Social director looking tired and weak

"How are you" I said

She lay down on the sick bed and managed to lay on
her back while still looking at me

"I'm okay"

"i heard about what happened this morning, I'm
sorry" I said as I stretched my hands that contained
the poly bag with the apples

"Whats inside?" she said

"Apples" I replied

"I can't eat them" she replied

"oh, okay"

"when will you be released?" I asked

"My husband is coming to pick me today" she said

"you live in Imo?" I asked

"yeah" she replied with a smile

"Alright… get well soon" I said as I began to walk
towards the door; as I was a few steps away from the
door to leave her sickbay room, I turned

"You did well Sandy, I'll take it from here" I said

She smiled at me and nodded.

I walked out of that room with the power of a
resurrected Jesus, I now had full control of the
activities of social night and the platoon, the fight
that was going to pull up if I had dismissed Sandy
from her position had disappeared and now I can
remove and put whomever I want in social night
activities without having to fight with Nafisat who
had a lot of power if Sandy was backing her.

I took a big bite off the apple I tried to give Sandy
and walked off to begin actualizing the plans for
tonight's Cultural dance.

Now I didn't write it in my past records but two days
ago, I had started sewing up a masquerade costume
for the cultural dance, platoon 6 had played by the
rules and gotten nothing so far, I was now prepared
to play by my own rules, I and a few platoon
members picked out grasses/leaves to deliver to the
tailor, it was top secret information that only I and
a few guys knew, I was prepared to crash the cultural
dance presentation by letting the masquerade loose
and join the cultural dance finals tonight, without
permission from Sandy so both the dancers and the
masquerade would be confused but we'd at least get 1st
to 3rd position; but with Sandy now out of the
picture, I'll crash the dance practice without anyone
being able to oppose me, Not Sandy and without
Sandy no one else except the platoon officer or Mrs
Eneda can stop me and Mrs Eneda likes to let her
mad platoon leader loose.

"ALL CULTURAL DANCERS, MEET ME AT THE BACK OF
THE PARADE GROUND AFTER LUNCH" - IKAN (Via
Whatsapp)

All the dancers did assemble at the back of the
parade ground but the most interesting person out of
all of them was their tall Yoruba leader Seyi; he was a
dark tall Yoruba boy but he was special tbh.

I told him about my plan to bring a masquerade to
the presentation tonight and he was hyped, he didn't
complain or say anything he just simply said

"okay, we'll be ready"

I was a little impressed, this was one of the few people
that had not opposed something I said, I watched
their dance practise for a while until I was called by
Majeed

"Yo whats up" - Isaac

"Bruh, come oh Platoon Officer is refusing to release
the girls for volleyball " - Majeed

"They can practise later, she's doing her marching
practise" - Isaac

"Bro, they said we should come and play right now" -
Majeed

"What the fuck" -Isaac

"Yes, they are waiting for us now" - Majeed

"They just said we won best losers, how come we are
playing right now" - Isaac

"They just came to call me" - Majeed

"I'm on my way" - Isaac *cuts call

Now here's something you need to know, there's a
competition called Platoon Parade, now this parade is
the most important competition in the NYSC camp,
its more important than any social night competition,
more than anything in camp, Platoon officers will
have to march with their platoon and their marching
will be graded by army officials, The short army
commandant said

"Platoon officers are responsible for how their
platoons do at the marching parade"

"We don't announce the last position for other
competitions but for Inter platoon Parade we will
announce the losers" he said as he laughed his way
back into the pavilion

"Also I will punish the officer whose platoon ends up
in last place and reward the officers that win first
place" he added as he walked away, the glow on the
officers face as he said this made me scared.

So our platoon officer Mrs Chisom had been
recruiting people and unlike other platoons that were
willing to teach AND GUIDE PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T
MARCH, Platoon 6's platoon officer Mrs Chisom didn't
do that.

"Let me see your leg" she'd say and look at you

"Shift this way" she'd say

If you didn't get the marching at first try she'd
remove you and now, out of 150 people, I don't know
if she had up to 50 people marching, she even removed
me.

But that's not the problem, the problem is in those 50
people she picked, all 5 of our volley ball girls team
was in there and she didn't want to let them leave to
go for volleyball.

After lunch platoons did their practise for the
marching competition, played football and the volley
ball competitions but she was refusing to let the girls
go and play volleyball because her marching squad
was too small and not going to well because of her
impatience.

I walked with so much determination, a few steps
away from the platoon 6 gathering I was joined by
Majeed and miracle( Sports director).

"How do we convince her to let them go" said miracle

"i and Majeed will use the usual whining style" I
replied

"Make we go" said Majeed

We did our best to smile and tell her what was going
on but she kept angryily telling us to leave

"Get out from my front!" she'd say

Miracle had to tell us to leave her for a while, I had
started walking a few steps away from the platoon
when it really hit me

THIS WOMAN IS FUCKING WITH US BECAUSE WE ARE
PLAYING WITH HER

I turned back and walked straight to the platoon.

"Joy, Nafisat, Grace, Speedy--"

"What are you doing" said Mrs Chisom as she walked
to the from of the platoon and stood right in front
of me, I ignored her

"Oluchi, Chisom, Anita, I'm waiting for you at the
volley ball court" I said

"come and meet me there" I proceeded to leave when
the army lady (mRs Chisom) dragged my hand and
tried to slap me, but she was too short to reach my
face

"What are you doing!?"

"didn't I tell you to leave"

"I AM TELLING YOU, THAT THE GIRLS HAVE A GAME
RIGHT NOW!"

"YOU ARE TELLING ME TO LEAVE WITHOUT THE
PLAYERS!, DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU??" I
replied, she was speechless then this girl(Our flag
bearer) popped out from the platoon line

"Our game is not today its tomorrow" she said

I was about to answer then Stephanie another girl

"But the game is tomorrow, what are you doing sef"
said Stephanie

I almost ran mad, I had never shouted since I came
to camp, but trust me this was the loudest shout I
had ever done

"I JUST FUCKING TOLD ALL OF YOU, THAT THEY
HAVE CALLED PLATOON 6 TO PLAY RIGHT NOW"

"WILL I FUCKING TELL THE GIRLS TO COME PLAY IF
ITS NOT TIME??"

"I TOLD YOU TO RELEASE THE GIRLS AND YOU GUYS
ARE DELAYING, IF WE LOSE THIS MATCH BECAUSE OF
YOU PEOPLE'S NONSENSE"

"ITS NOT MY BUSINESS" I screamed at the top of my
voice and because no one had ever see me lose my
composure; everyone was shocked including mrs
Chisom, I walked away.

Mrs Chisom later released the girls and they won
platoon 9 and qualified for semi finals.

After buying them pure water and glucose-D, I left
the game so I don't shout at the girls to much if they
play terribly and so I don't get a heart attack but
when I came back

"Presido we won!"

"Presido!" screamed Joy from the Volleyball court

I started running towards the court and Joy ran
towards me and without thinking, without planning
for it, I lifted her up in a long embrace and she
wrapped her hands around my neck and her legs
around my back and we cheered and laughed; but we
finally noticed that the rest of the team was looking
at us and I let go. (It was really awkward)

I realized in as much as I wanted to take control of
the social activities of platoon 6, I'd need to appoint
the Social Director role to somebody, somebody that'd
like to listen and take advice and one person came to
my mind, Kenny! She was a short Yoruba girl that
had been with us planning every social night, she was
always doing something to help and she liked to
gossip and I felt like she'd do a great job

"Kenny!" I called out

She ran to meet me

"Yes presido"

I looked at her for a while and smiled

"you're the new Social director" I said

"eh?" she replied

"yeah" I said and nodded

She started walking away and shaking her head

"no oh prez, I can't oh"

I followed her

"Kenny, you're the only one that I think can do this
job"

"Majeed, come and help me beg her" I called out to
Majeed who was passing by and together we knelt
down to beg her and… of course she agreed

"Alright Kenny, your first job is lets get this cultural
dance thing started"

She nodded, a new power had been inserted, man…
I'm good sometimes

Come evening a few hours to our cultural dance
presentation, Seyi called me

"The drum is missing" - Seyi

"what??" - Isaac

"We can't find the drums"- Seyi

"I'll go ask around" - Isaac *cuts call

"who's that" asked Kenny

"Its Seyi, he said the practise drum for cultural dance
is missing" I said

"jesus" said Kenny as she began sweating, from the
few minutes I spent with her, I realized she was easily
stressed

I, Kenny and a few girls from the dance group
started going round camp tracing the drums and
gongs, turns out the NYSC camp only gave out one set
of drums and instruments for practise, after over 30
minutes of searching for these instruments we were
led to the back of the army people's quarters and
right there, platoon 4 had been using it since, I told
you Pius (Platoon 4 leader) was a snake

He saw me and smirked

"bastard, wetin you dey do here"

"I'm going to need those instruments Pius" I replied

As I walked towards the people playing the drums

"we're using it" said his assistant

Pius was a cunning Yoruba nigga and he was short (I
must emphasize), both of his assistants were tall
slender pretty women, so Pius would be in the middle
with both tall women walking on his left and right,
stupid ass nigga(I'm just jealous).

"We can't give you the drums until we're done" replied
the slender lady from his right

"Is that so" I said as I came closer to her, I have a
bad habit of flirting with both his girls (Especially
the slimmer one by the right, Moremi) anytime I
catch him outside the hostel, this short bastard would
just keep looking at me while I do so.

I walked so close to her till I was just a step away
from her, she gave me a side eye and came closer till
her boobs were touching my chest

"You're going to have to wait for the drums, Platoon 6
leader" she said

"How long are we talking" I said with a smirk

"How long will it take for you guys to finish" she
asked the platoon 4 dancing group behind her

"Like 10 minutes!" replied the dance leader

"You heard him" Moremi replied and looked up at me
with a smirk, this lady was enjoying this

"Sure, I'll wait" I moved back finally putting space
between us

Pius took one look at me and the platoon 6 dancers
with me

"after all this una no go win anything" he said and
his other slender escort laughed out loud while
Moremi still looked into my eyes like she was looking
for something

"why do so much when you're going to lose" she said

"we'll see about that" I replied and smirked

"i prepared a special gift for you platoon 4 people" I
added and walked back to join the group and wait, I
was excited to show them my special gift.

"Presido, you like women" said Kenny who had been
looking at me with a disgusted face the entire time,
my heart broke.

After a few minutes of waiting they gave us the drums
with Moremi still staring at me as they left for the
social hall, it was already getting dark.

I waited for Seyi and he finally came after we fought
for the drums with platoon 1 who had claimed the
drums as Seyi was yet to appear.

After a few minutes of negotiation, we agreed to 10
minutes of usage each, I and the platoon leader of
platoon 1 shook hands on it.

The competition was wild, I let Seyi and the cultural
dance girls get ready in the social hall, while Kenny
dressed them with their leaves blouses and skirts and
the ankle bracelet made with soft drink covers.

"I'll leave this to you" I said to Kenny as I walked
away to get our costume.

The tailor lady with whom I shared the "design" and
sewed the outfit with sighed with relief as she handed
the costume to me

"Good luck" she said with a smile, I smiled and
nodded.

As I bounced into the hall with the costume in my
hand, it was so big that everyone noticed it, every
head in the hall turned as I walked past and it so
happens that at that moment Ski by Young Thug
started playing in my earpiece.

Sophie and Victor stared even harder than anyone
else while Moremi came to meet me

"I see this is the weapon you spoke of" she said as she
came closer to me

"I don't play ma'am" I replied with a smirk and
walked closer

Kenny popped out in between us and pushed us apart

"Presido, no time for this oh!" she said as she dragged
me to where the dancers were dressing

"who's going to wear this costume now" said Kenny

"because you are not going out there, not after that
night"

"what do you mean, people liked the song" I replied

"but we failed" said Kenny (she says what she thinks
in such an unfiltered way)

One of of platoon 6 boys came in running and
jumping, this nigga was always happy (His name is
Arrival, I know its weird asf)

"Arrival! Come!" I called

He came, still running around happily

"You're going to wear this costume" and when I give
you the signal you'll go outside and just jump and
dance around the dancers" I said

"So my job is just to go out there and run and jump
abi?" he asked

"Yeah"

"It'll soon be time for Platoon 6" said grace as eh ran
inside breathing fast

Kenny rushed the dressing on the girls and Seyi came
to me

"We're ready" he said

"Y'all are the best fucking dancers out here" I said

"I'm not even fucking kidding" I said

"Platoon 6!" said the announcer

"Platoon 6 come and make your presentation!"
repeated the announcer

"Go out there and kill it!" I said as I pushed Seyi from
the hall into the Stage

The presentation was bangers! Everybody was shocked
when the masquerade came out but I smiled like the
professor from money heist, these judges gave us
second position, I'll get them back.

That's all I can write for now, that army man is
making people that are still awake frog jump, bye!
