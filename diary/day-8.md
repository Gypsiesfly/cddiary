# "I want it that way"

Nope, we didn't win a single thing.

I began this today by going to the morning devotion and all that usual stuff, but on getting to the devotion Mrs Eneda told me I'd need to find BBB and Mr Macho, these are two different competitions in social nights.

**BBB** = Big Bold and Beautiful (simply look for a pretty fat girl to compete)

**Mr Macho** = Some muscular dude that has chest and all

But I noticed that most people didn't want to do anything, the platoon members kept bringing up excuses and ways for them to escape it but this good looking dude said something to me while I was going round the ranks to check on platoon 6 members:

"Sorry, I won't be able to do anything."

"Why?" I asked.

"Because I'll be leaving soon."

"Why do you want to leave? You just got here."

"A few of us will be doing our swearing in soon and we won't be able to leave camp to do it and return."

"So how can I help?"

"There's nothing you can do, they'd have to decamp us so we get it done."

I walked close to him and gave him a pat on the shoulder.

"If you need anything, you know where to find me," I said.

"Sure," he replied.

The parade ended and I went to eat breakfast with Sophie then went to the main hall for the NYSC classes where they teach you about things to do in the state you get shipped off to.

We sat together and she brought snacks for us both, and I ate in boredom.

"They say you're my NYSC husband," she said as she turned to look at me.

I continued to look at the teacher teaching in front of the hall so she wouldn't see me smirk.

"Is that so?" I said.

"Yeah," she said.

"I've never asked, when were you born?" I asked.

"You first," she replied.

"July 9th 2001."

She had this shocked look for a while and then burst out laughing then quickly regained herself so the campus police in the hall wouldn't come and tell her to keep quiet, I mean Unicorn was a campus police and she is the nicest person on camp.

"I'm older than you," she said.

I was listening to music in a low volume and the moment she said this the music switched from "Last Nite" by P-Square to "Breaking My Heart" by Michael Learns to Rock. My chest beat uncomfortably.

"You're my younger brother's age," she said again accompanied by laughter. "Little bro," she said as she tapped me on the shoulder.

I still couldn't say a single word, every time she called me little bro, I felt my temperature rise. What is wrong with me? I'm just a few days in, there's no way I've caught feelings this fast.

I let her keep calling me little bro and decided to focus on the games happening later today, but she was 25 and I was 23, and if she'd let me, I'd love her the same way a 27-year-old would or even a 30-year-old. Her age didn't matter to me, I just wanted her by me, smiling just like she was smiling as she called me her little bro. It appears that i am a finished man.

The volleyball game with Platoon 6 girls versus Platoon 4 girls was nerve-wracking. Joy hit like 15 serves per set and at some point even Speedy (that's fast but never hits the ball) managed to hit a ball and made us play into the fifth set.

Now here's where it gets tricky, the fifth set is supposed to be a game of 15 points, but the referee said he'd make it 10 points. This same referee had been trying to send our Volleyball coach Majeed out of the court and had been frustrating our players.

Joy's arms were red as fuck and I think she finally got tired as she missed a couple of serves that she should have gotten. WE LOST BY 2 POINTS IN THE FIFTH SET.

I refused to go talk to the girls because I had seen a couple of terrible plays from them and all I'd do was shout at them in frustration. PS: I had bought ice cream, pure water, and Glucose D for them so they could use it to calm down. I could also see that there were some of them that wanted to cry but held their tears. The games here might look like it's nothing, but each player played it with all their heart, so when they lost, the tears are almost natural. Did I tell you our Ankara contestant cried when she figured we had lost? That's how it is—put your heart in the games you play and play to your heart's content.

I walked quietly past the parade ground and thought about the next competition: **Karaoke**.

There are two levels:

**Level 1**: You choose a song and you have to lip-sync to it and whenever the DJ stops the song you have to keep singing—that's how you get points.

**Level 2**: The DJ picks a random song and you have to lip-sync to it and whenever the DJ stops the song you have to keep singing—that's how you get points.

**Rules**:
- You have to keep singing no matter what.

I had a few people—or person—that could do the Karaoke competition. Ify, the smiling one from the first day—remember she can sing...but...she can sing only holy songs. That was going to be a problem because I really didn't want us to be the only boring Platoon out there singing godly songs (Oh Lord, forgive me), so I decided to go out myself.

I had let the platoon members compete and all we'd done so far was lose, so I wanted to take matters into my hands and maybe—just maybe—get a win. I was going to compete for the karaoke.

The evening for the competition came and I sat quietly with Sophie as she pressed her phone silently. We had just eaten chicken suya together. I was lowkey scared of what I was about to do, but I just wanted to look at her.

"Hey Soph," I said.

She looked at me, her eyes sparkling in the dark.

"Yeah?"

"I'll be representing my platoon at the Karaoke competition today."

"That's good. Good luck," she said.

That was enough motivation for me. I got up and walked into the hall.

I had been deliberating between two songs on what I would sing for the first level of the competition:

1. "Hold Yuh" - Gyptian
2. "I Want It That Way" - Backstreet Boys

**For "Hold Yuh" by Gyptian**:
I wasn't sure everybody would have listened to "Hold Yuh" because everybody here always sang Odumodu Blvck and Shallipopi, and I wasn't sure I knew the lyrics very well.

**For "I Want It That Way" by The Backstreet Boys**:
I also wasn't sure everybody had listened to Backstreet Boys, but I knew this song really well, so I decided to sing it.

Now there was another issue: I had lost my voice from shouting at the Platoon 6 vs. Platoon 4 girls' Volleyball game earlier this afternoon, so my voice was cracked as fuck.

A few minutes to my turn, I remembered something from earlier today: When I had gone to purchase the bag of pure water and Glucose D for the girls' Platoon 6 vs. Platoon 4 volleyball game at the Queen of the Night's shop (I call the shop lady Queen of the Night), there was no change for what I was buying, so she gave me Throat Cleansing sweets to complete the change.

I took the sweets a few minutes before my turn to present, and I went outside to sing. I could see Mrs. Eneda laugh and cover her face as she heard my cracked voice, but everybody started singing back:

Me: "Tell me why??"

The crowd: "Ain't nothing but a heartache!"

Me: "Tell me why!?"

The crowd: "Ain't nothing but a mistake."

Everyone: "Tell me why."

Me: "I never wanna hear you say..."

Me: "Everybody!"

Everybody: "I WANT IT THAT WAY!"

All this time I was singing and walking around, and in the beginning of the song, I sat down on the pavement, lol. Mrs. Eneda and a few platoon members kept using hand signs to remind me that this wasn't a concert and I should keep singing and stop telling the crowd to sing with me. At the end of my performance, I was sure I had won over the hearts of the crowd, and maybe if there was only one level, I would have won 1st-3rd in that competition.

Level 2 of the karaoke game came, and the song given to me was "Gwagalada" by Buju and Seyi Vibez. They stopped the music at Seyi Vibez's part where the nigga speaks Yoruba (that nigga, smh), and I carried myself back inside the hall as the crowd screamed behind me as I had sung rubbish.

I found myself holding back tears in the hall as soon as my laughter died down. We had lost again.

The social night ended, and Sophie was calling me to meet her so she'd say goodnight before going to her hostel, but I couldn't see her. I refused to see her. I personally handled Karaoke because I wanted to bring a win home, and I failed. I was forcing a smile so my platoon members wouldn't think it was over for us, but if I appeared in front of Sophie, I was sure the tears were going to come gushing out. I was sure I wouldn't be able to cover my weakness in front of her, and I'd embarrass myself. So I walked out of the hall from the back door as my phone kept ringing, all the way to my hostel, and put up a fake smile.

"You did well."

"You did good, man."

When they'd tell me these things on the way, I'd feel so angry that I'd want to cry more, but I told myself I'd hold the tears till lights out so I'd cry on my pillow silently.

I entered my hostel, and my bunk neighbors were waiting to mock me. The stupid-ass Pius (he's the platoon leader of platoon 4) and three other idiots (I'll tell you about them later) have been mocking me every night after every platoon 6 failure. But this night, they felt a different aura of sadness around me, and they said nothing as I walked slowly to my bunk, jumped on my bed, and slept fully clothed. And I never had the opportunity to cry as lights out never came that night.
