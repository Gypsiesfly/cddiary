# Let the games begin

Today was a little bit different, I woke up by 4am wanting to take a shit, went to the toilets and they were all being used, the waiting period afterwards was something I wouldn't wish on my enemy.

And I didn't tell you guys a lot about the forthcoming competitions, after the swearing in, the competitions start and they start with a bang, TWO different sports.

1. Football for men
2. Volleyball for women

All platoons were to have a captain for both teams. The captain will then train the team and give them the rules. I knew the games would get started after the swearing in parade so I always met with the sports and social director for them to tell me their progress.

Back to the present: I didn't see Sophie in the parade for morning devotion, she said she'd be busy so, I just went ahead, Mrs ENEDA wasn't around early so I took the attendance and I've already said why I decided to take it, I want to know the members of the platoon and how they think.

As soon as I was done, I called Sandy and Miracle, the social and sports director respectively.

"Do you have your people ready Sports director"

"yeah, I have the football people ready"

"what about volleyball?"

"yeah, their coach will handle it"

"where is their coach?"

"he's a Muslim so he has gone to pray"

"okay"

"sandy, whats up, this night is Ankara night do we have anyone with Ankara?" I asked

"I've texted on the group, the only person with Ankara is Ify and she said she won't do the competition" she replied

"fuck" I replied

"alright, post on the group again, if anyone has Ankara, they should come out" I added

"you know we are playing football today yeah?" said miracle

"i know, who are we playing even" I asked

"Platoon 9" He replied

"how intriguing" I said

And as we were about to finish the volleyball coach came in, he was really short and light skin, you'd think he was an Igbo guy

"hey hafa, I heard una dey find me"

He said with his hand outstretched for a handshake. I shook his hand.

"yeah, what's your name again"

"Majeed" he replied

"How's our volleyball girls coming" I asked

"They've been training for a while now"

"I think they're ready" he added

"show me the team" I said

We began to walk while he called out for the girls. It consisted of like 10 girls and only like 1 could serve properly and we were playing our first match tomorrow, but from what I heard most of the other players from other platoons couldn't even serve or return serves.

I, miracle and Majeed watched the girls for a while while the parade continued in full form, remember the pretty tall girl that stood out, she was our number 1 server, the game was on, I have my generals and they are not losers.

NOTE TO SELF: In as much as I call some girls pretty, platoon women are off anything more than friendship, so far I have one rule, do not date your platoon members.

The morning parade ended and Sophie said she couldn't meet up cause she was busy but we would sit together for the afternoon class.

Then when we met in front of the hall, she was with this tinted white haired nigga, he was short but he kinda looked good and short good looking niggas are trouble, he and her were saying something but as soon as I got close they stopped and looked at me and stopped talking like they were keeping a secret.

The white haired nigga came for a handshake and as I was about to take his hand Sophie put his hand down and said

"he's the enemy, you shouldn't shake the enemy"

I smiled it off

"is that so" I replied

"I'm victor" said the tinted haired dude

"he's from my platoon, platoon 9 and we're planning our strategy for the competition tonight so stop trying to peek" she said while shifting with Victor to back me.

I felt my insides squeeze a little. They were acting as if they had been friends for a long time, I mean who is this guy even.

"We should go get seats" I said

"you can keep for me but I'll be sitting with victor, we've got a lot to plan" she said with a smile

My insides squeezed up a little more than before

"sure" I replied and quickly made way to the hall as 100s of other corp members had began rushing for seats.

I secured a seat in the middle of the hall, and found myself searching for Sophie with my eyes, I found her in front with victor, deep in conversation.

So far I had let the football coach find his boys and organize the practise matches and to imagine we were playing today had to be a fucking setup.

I and Majeed were going to play the volley ball girls during lunch as to practise for our tomorrow match.

What hurt me the most now was the fact that Sophie was sitting with someone else and from tonight we'd begin to clash our heads while competing. This made me smile a little because, I was looking forward to seeing how her mind worked and if she could compete with me if I put my mind to it.

Now I also forgot to write what happened the day before yesterday morning, here goes:

So I received messages from my Platoon officer MRs ENEDA that the board of Judges had called for a meeting to give us rules for the social games and sports and the schedule of the games so, all Platoons were to bring forth their Platoon officers, their platoon leaders, Social Director and sports director.

I & miracle joined arrived at the meeting venue after breakfast (just when the meeting was getting started) MRS ENEDA was already seated, she gave us a sign for us to find seats.

As we got seated, Sandy came in breathing like she had ran all the way.

The room was packed with Platoon officers, their platoon leaders, Social Directors, sports directors and the Board of judges and all of us in this room were going to start clashing to win competitions and prize-money really soon, just the thought of this gave me goosebumps and made me excited, every one here was a potential competitor..a commander in their own right.

The meeting was simply to give use the registration forms for all the available competitions and to give us a rule-book on what and what was not acceptable.

Here are the rules:

1. no hiring or renting of costumes or instruments in whatever guise
2. No use of microphones for drama and dance competitions
3. Songs and dance that do not project moral value are not allowed
4. Competitors are expected to face the judge while performing
5. The use of objects like knife, sharp objects, sticks, sticks and extinguishers are not allowed
6. To ensure a better usage of the stage, participants should not be more than 10 for drama and 6 for cultural dance
7. Competitors should be time conscious (5 minutes both cultural dance, cultural carnival displays and 10 minutes for drama)
8. Introductory greetings/speech for dance, drama and cultural carnival can be in local dialect but presentation must be done in English language to enable the judges and audience understand the presentation.
9. Platoons without any representative for any social activity or competition will be sanctioned
10. No cooking or presentation of cooked food during carnival
11. No monetary contributions in platoons for social activities
12. Ensure participants are creative in all their Outings

NOTE: The theme for cultural dance and drama competition is "Unity in Diversity". Acts that contravenes the cultural Heritage/Unity of our dear country must be avoided.

We all took our time going through the lists but number 11 was the one that caught my attention, no contribution of money??, when we were going to need money to actually win??

Sandy raised her hands and asked

"How are we supposed to contribute for things that need money if you say we should not contribute"

All the leaders, platoon officers and execs watched from sandy to the judge to answer the question

"You don't need to spend money for anything, we like creativity, we even give points for it, last year we had a platoon that made a boat out of carton and they won" she replied with a smile

Discussions burst through the silence as everyone could see this was bullshit.

"so if one person wants to do it or pay for it on his own is it possible" A short black muscular dude asked

"if you want to ask a question, raise your hand and when I call you, introduce yourself, your platoon, your position before you ask your question okay?" The judge replied

"Yes ma" he apologized

His name was Jude the platoon leader of Platoon 7, they were the Ghana to our Nigeria, the country closest to you can bite you or make you, Platoon 6 and Platoon 7 did assembly side by side, The NYSC band was on the right and by the left was platoon 7 so, we could easily hear each other announcements, I wasn't sure yet if I wanted to form an alliance with anyone yet, you need to know your cards before you can deal them else you trade a gold card for peanuts.

He asked if one person could pay for it and she replied yes.

And she also said we should submit the names of the people representing us in the events before the events happen.

The meeting ended and I, social and sports director and Mrs Eneda my platoon officer walked together, in my brain everything was coming together and the competitions had already begun, I asked sports director if he had gotten his football niggas ready and he said yeah and they had trained a lot. Then I asked social if we had the girl for Ankara tonight, she said she heard a platoon 6 girl had Ankara so she'd go find the girl as soon as we split ways.

The two of the directors left me and Mrs Eneda walking through the wide parade ground.

"I hope you're ready" she said, stopped walking and looked at me with a smirk, I didn't know what would come of all this or the cards I had at hand yet, but I knew I had cards and if pushed to the wall I would play the game to win and I really don't want Sophie and the white haired nigga to best me.

"yeah, my people are ready" I replied, smiling back.

"OKAY Oh" she replies and walks towards the officers quarters as the dust from the parade made her disappear, as soon as lunch is over Platoon 6 plays their first football match, damn, the game was on.

As soon as it was time for the games I ran to go and buy water and glucose D from the Mami market, but as I got really close to the market, the taller soldier came and started chasing us back.

"Hey" said a woman with her stall nearby

"Hey" I replied surprised

"I can bring the things for you, what do you want" she whispered

"Pure water and glucose" I replied

"Okay"

She came with the items and I paid for them and took them to our platoon base as we prepared to start playing, both teams were called to the podium to get a briefing and the game was on.

I forgot to tell you that I don't like football, and I don't watch it.

"Yo coach, I'll go check on the girls playing volleyball"

"Okay man" replied the platoon 6 coach, I'm calling him the platoon 6 coach because I don't know his name yet.

Note: The distance from the football field and the volley ball court was quite a lot.

I ran across the football field like a mad man all the way to the volley ball court where I saw majeed.

"Yo how far, how are we doing" I asked

"We're doing good, we'll play a friendly game against platoon 4 to test our hand" he replied

"Those are our girls" as he pointed to a group of girls gathered together.

The group consisted of a few girls:

1. Joy, remember the tall fine girl that stood out from the crowd, her. (She was the one that could serve)
2. Nafisat, she is a dark-skinned Muslim girl that always seems to be frowning,
3. Grace, grace was a the total opposite of Nafisat, she was light skinned woman that always seemed to be smiling
4. Speedy, now Speedy wore shades that were bigger than her face, she looked like a person with no emotions but as she was smiling at me right now which meant she has some in her
5. Oluchi is a darkskinned girl that wears medicated glasses, she was a generally quiet person so I don't know much about her
6. Chisom on the other hand is my Assistant platoon leader, we haven't talked much so far, but shes cool so I don't stress
7. Anita was a big black woman, her hands were huge

The team we were playing, platoon 4 on the other hand looked quite good as they were all able to serve the ball. While us platoon 6, we only had Joy, for some reason the pretty girl could do a lot of things.

"Joy, give me 20 services" said Majeed as he walked to her and slapped her arm

"Ouu" she replied

"Alright guys come together" I said, I wanted to give them a pep talk.

The team gathered around me and as I was about to start talking, a loud AHHH could be hard from the field, someone had scored!

"You guys can do this, teach these people who Platoon 6 member's are" and I clapped

"Lets go"

As soon as the practice match had started, I ran across the parade ground to where the football match was taking place.

"Who scored!" I shouted as I neared where platoon 6 members gathered.

"Its us!" shouted one of the players, the crowd by the side of the field was crazy.

"Good good " I said and balanced my hands on my waist.

Right then and there one of my players called for a sub, he was a muscular short dude who had been playing defender for us but I guess he was tired and wanted to sub out.

"Good game" I said as he got to the side of the field

"Thanks" he replied

"Who dey sub am!" shouted one of the players that was also subbed out

"where Anokoya dey!" shouted another platoon 6 member.

Turns out Anokoya went to ease himself and wasn't around so we needed someone to replace him.

"Make I sub in" said a big looking man with pot belly.

I looked at him and my spirit shook its head, I looked like I could run more than this guy, and he was supposed to defend??

"Go go go" said the player that just subbed out as he removed his blue colored jersey to give this nigga.

[BIG MISTAKE]

"Where's the sports director" I said to the assistant football coach as I pushed past the platoon 6 members and players

"He's not here" the assistant coach replied with his attention still on the field and right there, just few minutes after that nigga was subbed in, the person he was supposed to defend at the left wing zoomed past him and scored, we all had been screaming as we watched the process happen before our eyes.

Match score was now 1-1, this was a disqualification match so if we lost Platoon 6 will be out for good and could never win the cup.

I could feel my throat getting dry from all the shouting so I refused to watch this football match, only at Angel Reese games am I allowed to show so much emotion, so I left the boys and ran across the field to see the girl's friendly volley ball.

Fuck, we were getting cooked at the friendly volleyball also, Majeed just stayed quiet by the sidelines telling the girls:

"You're doing great joy"

"Speedy, you can do this"

WHILE THE GIRLS WERE PLAYING TERRIBLY!

My throat went dry, it seems like we aren't going to win anything the way these my members are playing.

"What the fuck are you doing!" I screamed finally as I could not hold my words back any more as Nafisat had just air-balled her serve and the ball didn't even get past the net, Anita had been missing balls that had come close to the net where she was.

Nafisat looked at me in frustration and waived her hand to tell me to leave her alone.

"Presido" said Majeed from the other side of the court.

"how far" I replied

He gave me the "Common-Bruh" look.

"Calm down" he said

"let the girls play"

"Okay okay fine" I replied as i walked away, I could feel my anxiety rise.

And just as I was heading towards the football field, I heard GOALLLLL!

The opposing team ran around in happiness, I jogged to the field and found out we had been scored in a penalty kick and it was 2-1 game now.

Now the remaining things that happened were really annoying. The girls lost the friendly volley ball match with platoon 4 terribly. We also lost the men's football qualifiers match to Platoon 10.

The trumpet was blown for students to go eat dinner and prepare for the social night, I didn't talk to either the football or volleyball team as I knew I was going to angrily talk to them and nothing good was going to come out of my mouth, I was in such a sour mood that people just passed by me and I never noticed them but just walked on.

My phone rang and it was Sophie.

"Hey, where are you" she asked

"I'm at the parade" I replied

"Meet me close to Mami market"

"Okay"

"Are you okay?" she asked

"yeah I am, see you soon"

I saw her and Unicorn waving at me as I got close to Mami market and we got dinner with both of them chatting as I just followed quietly.

Two losses in one day, that's bad.

It was time for social night and I had to go get a spot for my platoon, what is a spot? A spot is a space in the hall where people would prepare to present for their platoon, The hall is spacious but to make sure you have an advantage you have to select a nice space so you and your platoon members can plan or dress up before its time for them to present.

"Pres, we have found someone" said Sandy as she dashed into the hall carrying a bag.

"where is she" I asked

'she'll be here soon" she replied

Two other female platoon members dashed into the hall, it was Kenny and Amira.

"Is our girl here yet?" said Kenny

"No shes not" said Sandy as she began to pace around the hall restlessly.

"Fuck, Kenny, go and find that girl"

"do you have her number?" I asked

"i don't" she said

"Sandy why the fuck did you not collect her number!" I asked

"How am I supposed to know!" she replied

"I need her name and Passport photo so I can submit her as a competitor!" I replied

"Do you know her name?" said Sandy to Kenny and Amira, who both shook their heads.

Fuck this, talking about the problem is not the issue, we need to find a solution.

The hall was getting filled with other platoons and their contestants had started dressing up and our girl was yet to be found, jesus.

"Kenny, go to girls hostel and find her" I said as I walked over to her and placed my hand on her shoulder.

"Go!" i said

Kenny dashed out of the hall and as I followed her to the door, I was stunned by the crowd that was gathering in front of the hall for socials, it was packed like a concert. Fuck.

As soon as I turned back into the hall I caught eyes with the platoon 9 members gathered in front, a lot of buzz had started coming from the hall and it was because….THESE PLATOON 9 FUCKERS HAD AN ANKARA THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS MADE FOR A QUEEN, it was purple, had a very big and well shaped purple head-tie, a purple gown that flowed down to her ankles and a purple bag that was made out of the gown material to match, THERES NO FUCKING WAY THESE GUYS DID NOT SEW THIS WHOLE ATTIRE IN THIS CAMP! REMEMBER THE RULES???

Rule number 12: No monetary contributions in platoons for social activities

I can swear these niggas spent money! I walked up to their group and slowly caught Sophie's eyes, she walked closer to meet me.

"I know you're here to spy on us" she said with a smirk.

"Platoon 6 leader" she added

"Platoon 6, what are you doing here" Said the girl that was representing Platoon 9 in the contest, she was being dressed up.

"I just came to look" I replied

"Come and be going" said Sophie as she held my hand and dragged me away from Platoon 9's space.

"I haven't even done anything" I said

"Not yet you haven't"

"you want to copy us"

"Are you trying to tell me you guys didn't spend money on that costume" I asked

She smirked at me

"See you outside" she said and cat-walked stylishly back to her platoon space as I watched her from behind as her hips went left and right.

"Umm presido, leave woman!" said Sandy

As Kenny dashed into the hall with a short and skinny dark skinned girl.

"shes the one" said Sandy

"Wheres your ankara, start wearing it" I said

"You guys should assist her" I added

I turned to face the opposite corner as the girls used a wrapper to act as a wall to cover the girl as she changed into her ankara, I just looked all around me as the hall was filled with people dressing up their contestants, felt like hunger games to me.

In no time she was ready, her ankara was nothing special but her smile was special, she had this shiny white teeth that blinged in the night as she smiled.

Majeed burst into the hall.

"where our girl dey" he said

"Na she be this" I said as I pointed at her

Majeed walked closer to her.

"Look at this pretty girl, fine woman, Asanwa" he said as she began to blush, I saw what he was doing and I had to join in.

"Do you know you are the finest woman here?" I said as I also drew closer to her and Majeed.

"She does not know" said majeed

"but we we know" I said

"look at that smile majeed, damn" I said

"She looks like a queen" he replied

The truth about this competition is…we had no shot at winning 1st - 3rd, Sophie's platoon 9 had a girl in purple looking like a queen, Platoon 4 had a girl in yellow Ankara that came with earrings, bag, necklace and a nice slippers, Platoon 10 had a girl in a bright red Ankara, we weren't going to win but we just needed our girl to go out there feeling good, from the looks of it Platoon 9 was going to win this.

"Alright, all contestants stay in a straight line!" said the judge as she came into the hall.

All the contestants lined up and wore their tags labeled from 1- 10, I pinned the number 6 tag on the girl competing for Platoon 6 and escorted her to where all the contestants were lined up.

"You are the finest girl in this fucking world"

"do you hear me?" I asked

She nodded, she had begun to be nervous.

Kenny was close by me cleaning her sweat with a hanky.

"You go out there and show them who you are" I said

"You just smile and wave and just walk like I showed you" said Majeed as he caught up with us.

All the other girls on the line were looking at us weird because of how we were hyping her, I and majeed hyped her from the moment they called platoon 1 to go in till it was her turn to catwalk in.

Well, like I said, we didn't get 1st to 3rd, Platoon 4 got 1st, Platoon 9 got 2nd, Platoon 10 got 3rd.

Look Platoon 9 should have gotten 1st but when they asked their contestant Vicky a question, she stammered and she got it wrong so points were deducted from her.

Another loss from Platoon 6, well, tomorrow is another day with another competition, Our volleyball girls and Karaoke night, I hope we win something, signing off to bed, goodnight.
