# "Hey 1229"

So I picked a bed opposite the entrance door in case something was happening, it'd happen to the person at the entrance first and I'd notice it, roll from my top bunk bed unto the floor then under my bed to avoid it (courtesy of my boarding school experience).

I checked my watch and it was 4:30am and I picked up my bucket and soap and went to have a bath.

It was early so not a lot of people had come outside. The bathroom doors were made of zinc and right inside was a pit latrine toilet, to my surprise it actually looked neat.

As soon as I was done with my bath and started heading inside a heard a trumpet blaring in the hostel, I knew something was up and started running to my bed to quickly dress up.

I was told by my bed mate not to wear my white and white if I had not registered or done clearance, so I put on my normal clothes and started heading to the parade ground.

Soldiers could be seen everywhere saying, "double up", "if you are still here you are wrong"

I found this fascinating because it reminded me of boarding school.

The parade ground was a large space of land with brown sand, behind it were a few buildings and a market called Mami market where I had bought my white crocs from the night before( I didn't talk about that, my bad).

People formed lines on the parade ground and I joined the line closest to me, A man came out and thanked us for coming to Imo camp, then proceeded to call someone to read a paper for us, which was called "Meditations" One of those aspire to inspire write ups.

I took my time to survey the people around me, as the day was getting brighter. After the morning meditation, was the Praise and worship, the Muslims were also asked to go to the mosque for their own prayers.

"its time for your morning exercise" said a man-o-war official.

Now by now I had understood the hierarchy of the officials on the Camp
1. The camp director
2. The camp commandant
3. The Soldiers
4. The NYSC official
5. Man-o-war

If you asked me the work of the man-o-war, I truly can not explain but I know they were friendly and they took our morning Exercises.

They proceeded to divide the camp to two parts, the ones that had done clearance and taken their white and white official uniforms and the ones that had not.

We were told that if we had not done clearance we should not put on white and white as a lot of us had bought white and white from home.

The one's on white and white were taken towards the building on the parade round to start marching,

Those of us on Normal clothes were told to do our exercises in front of the Official pavilion where officers and officials watched the parade directly from the front.

While I was thinking of what to do, a dark skinned girl with really white teeth approached me, smiling like those people from Jehovah's witness church when they are about to preach to you, I stood there confused but still kept my mean look, and yeah my mean look is really mean, it should tell you not to come close to me but this lady was right in front of me smiling

"Hey" she said

".….Hey…" I replied wondering what she wanted

"Can I keep my files in your bag" she replied

I fell into confusion

Some random girl just asked me to keep her file in my bag, a stranger, someone she doesn't even know, wtf.

"are you sure? You don't even know me"

She changed her stance to the cute anime girl stance

"then let me have your number" she said

"so I can easily reach you after the morning exercise to return my files" she added

"sure…" I said

So she put her and another girl that came with her's files in my bag and we all went for the exercise, we were told to drop our bags under the pavilion.

The exercises began, we were told to stand in rows while the man-o-war that showed us the exercises stood in front of us, there was a very loud girl at my left that kept shouting a lot and there was another girl in all white standing by my right, she carried a wide smile and did the exercises with excitement, the kind of excitement you'd see from a rich mans child that finally finds a way to do things poor people's children do but most importantly, our legs kept bumping into each other

"my bad" id say

"sorry" she'd reply with a bright and excited face

She weirded me out but I just really wanted to be done with the exercises

After about 30 minutes we were done, I found the girl that gave me her files and turns out her name is Fave. She was weird, behaved like those folks who found happiness in every situation, and as a pessimist myself I don't like those kinds of people.

Breakfast was bread and egg but I only took the bread and went to save it in my box.

Now there are a few things I want to tell you about me.
1. I am a millionaire: How that happened: I won some competition and won quite a lot of money, I can't say more than that.
2. I can't get food poisoned because id then have to use the pit latrine toilet more than I'm supposed to, then probably leave with some bacteria and get sick
3. Yes and I almost forgot, sometimes there's no water, imagine wanting to take a shit and there's no water, like bruh, I just want to quietly go through this camp and go home.

I was told to register my name in the "Book of life" a supposedly large book where the names of Corpers are, so if your name is not there, it means you were never a corper.

The registration process was really long
1. Put your name in the Book of life
2. Register for your Meal card (a card used for collecting food)
3. Register your banking details for NYSC allowance
4. Know your platoon
5. Register in your platoon
6. Collect your Uniform from your platoon
7. Collect your platoon/NYSC ID
8. YOU ARE OFFICIALLY A CORPER, CONGRATS LOL

By the time I was done, it was pretty late, my corp shoes were smaller so I just exchanged them with a girl with bigger shoes.

And yes my platoon officer was a woman, she gave this vibe of I-don't-really-care-much-but-I-like-competing-so-lets-fucking-do-this.

She was a light skinned lady that looked like she could scream at me any second now, but she also looked very strong, not in the muscles but in her head, you'd know she knew how to pull strings and how to make things happen for her, she was always chewing something either its food or a toothpick.

I was about to leave when I saw the girl from the exercise this morning, remember? The one that looked like she was just happy to be doing what normal people do, I just decided to go say hi

"hey" I said after getting within one feet away from her, she turned

"you" she replied with her wide smile on her face

"you" I responded

"you seem to like to kick people" I said with a smile

"you're the one who wouldn't stop kicking me" she said while trying to hold all the NYSC clothes in her hands

"I'm Ikan" I said with my hands outstretched for a handshake

"I'm Sophie" she said (smiling) as she shook my hand

She had her NYSC ID on her neck and it read "1229"

And here's a small tip about the ID'S and platoons

Platoons are from number 1-10, that's about 100 to 150 people per platoon, the last number on your ID signifies your platoon, I had 1066 and bruh, I kid you not, my nickname in secondary school was 626 and 6 is my lucky number so, I keep thinking someone above is fucking with me.

We talked for a bit and something about her was different, I was coming from a grim dark place and these few minutes we spoke felt like she shined a light into a dark large hall in the depths of my soul. She smiled a lot and for a person like me that didn't smile it was different.

I proceeded to leave and had already walked a few steps away from her when it hit me, there are about a million people in this camp, the probability of me seeing her again was really small, and I liked how bright she was and how every experience she was having was some fun thing, should I turn back? Get her number?

The funny thing is, I know when someone is going to be so important to me, I know it in my guts and something told me, if I took her number she'd be very important to me in this camp and it always ends in tears.

I told myself "fuck it" I just came from home where I had to separate my parents from killing each other, where I had to wake up early and run outside if I heard their yells so at least they wouldn't get violent in front of me, where I had to lock my mom in the room with me and convince my dad to drop the bottle and go to his room and dress up for the job he has. My life has been so dark so far and this woman's smiles make me feel just a little better and I'd do anything to just be a little happier.

So I went back, we exchanged numbers. But even after just leaving her presence, my body was itching me to text her, what will she think of me, what if she gets irritated that I just took her number and now I'm trying to text her just minutes after, I SAID FUCK IT, I'm going to text her and if the vibe is wrong, I wont do it again

And my first whatsapp text was
"Hey, 1229"

The double check marks appeared

….…..(she was about to reply)

"Hey 1066" she replied

"the temptation to call you by your number" I replied

"you already did" she texts back

"i like it tho" she adds

"sounds like we're in a sci fi movie" she adds again

"What are you doing by 3:30" I texted

"i'll be going to the parade ground, you?" she replies

"same, I'll be there too"

"Hopefully your legs work well this time" she adds

"you test me" I replied

"Lets meet up if you want" I added

"sure" she replied.
