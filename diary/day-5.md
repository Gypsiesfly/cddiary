# Parade till you faint

Today went almost the same way as the other days just a few changes. The officers woke us up really early asf, blowing a trumpet everywhere as early as 4AM. I was already awake and someone had stolen my bailer from my bucket, fuck! I had to use the bigger bucket as a bailer to the bigger bucket, you know, the one that is transparent.

I dressed up and made my way to the parade ground, all around me were army people pointing torches and shouting "double up".

I had texted Sophie a while back, she said her stomach still hurt.

"gas?" I texted back

"yeah" she replied

After the morning devotion, we rendezvoused at my line and I finally noticed the stomach pain was serious. I told her she had to go to the clinic, she refused at first but after much persuasion she finally accepted and I watched her walk away and disappear into the distance.

Then the ASC told us to form up according to Platoons. I went to my platoon and I noticed we had 4 platoon members with the yellow band (Campus police):

1. One was the big flag bearer, his name is Adesuwa
2. Was the other big flag bearer with potbelly, I don't know his name
3. The third was the big girl that was Social director
4. And the fourth was a pretty girl named "Iffy" and she was really pretty, I was wondering why they'd pick a pretty girl for police, she had a "don't talk to me face" tho.

We had a couple of big guys at the back, and a guy that looked responsible as fuck at the rightmost side of the lines. He had a red colored id card holder, the rest of us had green. I also noticed the pretty tall girl that stood out.

I chose to stay at the left most line so I could see the parade pavilion in front, the police at my back and my platoon members.

Also, Angel Reese was playing basketball today so I had to constantly update my google feed to see who was winning. LSU was playing Auburn and one of the Auburn's point guards was the LSU coach's former player but was removed from the team by the coach so, she played with extra energy whenever they met LSU, and Auburn was a very violent team.

While I was reading the scores, my Platoon officer walked in, and now I know her name, MRS ENEDA. She asked me to follow her and point a torch while she took attendance so I did, and I looked at everyone's face while doing so because I needed to know who was who.

After that we went for breakfast and ate quietly together, then went for danger awareness class, where they'll tell us what to do if our assigned states end up being dangerous and how to protect ourselves from danger. The hall was filled with over 900 people with the rest 100 people being outside the hall.

Sophie was sleeping on my shoulders as she was still in pain. She talked about the parade happening tomorrow and how lucky I was that my NYSC uniform fit me perfectly.

"That's not true, my shirt's a little slacky" I replied.

"Sure" she says and proceeds to fall asleep on my shoulder.

I usually don't allow cringe things like this but for some reason, I did my best to make sure she enjoyed her sleep and even though there were a thousand other people in the room, I only saw her and her being calm and happy was all that mattered.

She later woke up and went outside to take a call and the class ended so I went to look for her. I found her at the side of the hall behind the hall where we were having classes.

"Hey" I said.

She didn't reply.

"Hey, are you okay?" I proceeded to turn her to face me as all this time she was backing me.

As I successfully turned her to face me, I see tears trickling from her eyes, she was crying really hard.

"I'm tired" she said. "I wanna go home. I hate it here. Nothing is working for me here."

I stood there speechless, because, I hate here too. Her presence is what makes me like this place. If she goes home I'm going to become sad and depressed as hell. And even though she makes me happy, I want her happy too and right now the smile I was always used to was replaced with tears. But even with this she still shone in brightness, still looked pretty. I put my hands into her bag and brought out her dark big shades.

"You know, you're like really strong, yeah? You're a strong woman, you've got a reputation to keep." She looked at me and cleaned her eyes, then I gave her a nod of approval.

"That's what I'm talking about," I said and proceeded to wear her dark big shades to cover her teary eyes. I put her NYSC cap on and arranged it to cover her face.

"Okay, let's go" I said.

And she followed behind and as we walked through the crowd of people rushing to leave the hall, it felt private, it felt like we were private in a public place. She caught up with me and stretched out her left hand as if telling me to take them and I held it and walked her out of the crowd.

We didn't utter a single word while we were walking as if we were communicating already. She was sad and it was my job to escort her to the hostel.

We finally got to the front of girls' hostel and she waved and walked inside.

I, on the other hand, had a job to do. It was lunch time and I had to make sure the folks serving food for platoon 6 served my members right, so I walked to the front of the hall where food was being served and found the cooler with the letters "6" written on it.

Here's how the food serving is supposed to work: All platoons have their cooler and the platoon members are supposed to line up in front of their coolers to take food. Also, the kitchen directors organize platoon members that would be sharing food for each platoon and the ones that would be carrying the giant coolers for food.

And for today, the two people in charge of platoon 6 food was a light skin guy and remember, that dude that looked responsible with the red NYSC card holder? Him too. Both of them volunteered.

I checked on them if they were okay and they were, so I left after arranging the chairs that were blocking the food line from moving properly.

It's time for parade and maybe I haven't told you but this parade is for the swearing in parade that is happening tomorrow, so this was the last preparatory parade for it, and all the marching we had been doing was for tomorrow.

The "I will eat your blood" soldier had us march a lot. Any small error he would tell them to start again, so in total we started again over 6x more.

"AY what are you doing! Go back and start again!"

Sophie was still sick so she couldn't march and hid behind the parade where a grass blocked her from being seen. I joined her there later after I got tired of marching from scratch again and again. She rested her head in silence and we had been there for some minutes until Dapo the "I will eat your blood" soldier came at us with a cane and everyone ran away from the area and joined the parade.

Every 6pm everybody has to stand at attention no matter what you're doing for the Nigerian flag to be let down from the pole, while a soldier blows the trumpet and as soon as it's done, you can continue doing what you were doing.

After the parade we were all exhausted and we started walking to mami market to get dinner.

Sophie had made a new friend, and like Sophie this girl had very good vibes, always smiling and had a cute small swelling on her forehead that made me give her the nickname "Unicorn". She was dark in complexion, was a little big but had one of the best energies you could ever find anywhere.

All the corpers were running to get their corper uniforms fixed, resized or ironed for the next day which was the swearing in parade but I had ironed mine by placing my box on it since I got it so it was already stretched.

We walked silently, Sophie lost in her stomach pain, Unicorn lost in thought and I lost in my strategies. Tomorrow was going to be a tough day but as usual I will meet it with equal toughness.

Alright I've got to go for the NYSC movie, I bought an apple for Sophie though.
