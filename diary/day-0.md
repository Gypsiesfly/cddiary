# Day 0 - Just so you know

Writing this book, this diary, I keep asking myself, why am I writing this?why am I writing a book about the NYSC camp, I figured out the answer. It's because of her.

This book is about her, Sophie. It's been like two months since camp finished but I still think of her, is it love? Is it infatuation? I don't know.

All I know is I think about her sometimes even now that she hasn't picked my calls or returned my texts.

I once told her our relationship is a breakfast club situation, she'd reply with, "don't say that, we'd still talk."

It's like I know the future lols

So yeah, as pathetic as it seems , this book is about a girl, a lady, that brightened my world in camp and maybe would have been nice if she brightened my world after, but it is what it is.

My hands are shaking as I type this but yeah, College diary (a breakfast club situation) is about her and I hope she's doing okay.
