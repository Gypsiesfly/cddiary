# Day 11: "A lovely day"

In the words of Bill Withers, "Just one look at you and I know it's gonna be a lovely day." Today is going to be lovely.

I woke up tired of all the politics and everything and realized Sophie and I had spent so much time competing for our platoons that we had no time to spend with each other throughout the week. I decided we should go on a date. Where? I didn't know. I just knew I wanted to spend a few hours looking only at her, so I had to send the risky text first.

"Hey, what's up?" I texted.

"Heyy, I almost got in a fight :(" she texted back.

"Let's go on a date," I replied. "You can tell me about the fight :)"

"Where are we going? :)" she asked.

"You'll see :)" I said.

"What time?"

"Does 12 pm work for you?"

"Yeah, it does."

"See you soon," I replied.

As soon as she cut the call, I found myself hopping close to my bunk, and my bunkmate gave me a weird look.

"That platoon 9 girl don text am," said my Yoruba neighbor.

"Na the only time this man dey smile," said Short Pius, the platoon 4 president.

"Omo, I wan go church. My platoon has started winning; I gats thank God," I said as I walked to church.

Sundays are the only days you get to wear clothes other than the white t-shirt and white shorts or NYSC green uniform. But some girls abuse it and dress anyhow. Right now, the food-serving lady was chasing a girl from collecting food because she wore a transparent gown. I could see through the gown from where I was, but I'm not gonna lie—I liked what I saw.

The church was a makeshift one, made from a few canopies with a few NYSC members as ushers. I stayed for the praise and worship but left as soon as the word started. I can't stand boring sermons, and I basically told the platoon to go to church today because God had helped us win a few of our competitions. As I checked my watch, it was 12 pm, and it was time for me to leave.

Sophie and I met at Mami Market. She had on these Fela jeans trousers and a blouse—it was pretty.

"Hey," I said.

"What's up? Where are we going?" she asked as she followed behind me.

"You'll see," I said as I carried one chair. "Bring the other one," I added.

She dragged it along, and we came to a stop under a plantain tree that faced the parade ground. The trees blocked people from seeing us and also shielded us from the sun. I didn't want any of our platoon folks to see us and interrupt our makeshift date. I gave her a bag that had an apple and a drink, and we both ate our apples silently.

"Tell me something about your family," I said.

"What do you want to know?" she replied.

"Everything and anything."

"Okay, so… my dad inherited a fancy art gallery in Paris."

"Yes!" I said. "I knew you'd be a silver spoon kid."

She smiled. "I'm not really a silver spoon. More of a spoon," she added.

"You just told me your dad owns a fancy art gallery in Paris," I said.

"He left," she said. "He left us to stay in Paris, and he hasn't returned since then." She took another bite of her apple.

Silence fell. I didn't want to spoil the mood, but I wanted to know more.

"Do you guys still talk?"

"Yeah, he calls and sends money from time to time."

"What about your mom? Are you guys close?"

"Yeah, I'm really close to her," she replied.

We talked about a lot of things after that. Nevertheless, our date was ended by the soldier blowing his trumpet everywhere, signifying it was sports time/platoon parade practice.

During sports time, the news that Platoon 6 won best losers for volleyball sent the platoon roaring with excitement. I stood quietly and watched as things moved in slow motion before Majeed walked toward me.

"I told you we'd get it," he said as he playfully punched my shoulder.

"We didn't get best losers for football," I said.

"So we're out?"

"Yeah, we're out," he said.

"I need you to train the girls. We can't fail again," I said.

"I'll do my best," he replied as he called the girls together.

The short army commander announced that the NYSC DDG would be coming to the camp. I don't know who that is, but the dude seems important, so we'd be doing some preparatory salute and parade to prepare for when he comes. He called the Color Party and the parade commander to get ready.

When Sophie and I were walking, we were ambushed by some Showmax folks. They needed me to support an indie movie. Sophie was down with it and made friends with the woman almost immediately, but I just had to support because Sophie was supporting.

Now, drama time came, and Sandy and I had agreed to do my drama. My drama goes like this:

**Unity in Diversity (MY DRAMA)**

A Hausa man comes in riding a donkey (it's going to be another corper imitating a donkey) and enters the stage. Then he sees the Igbo man on stage with a dead woman that has a bloody Nigerian flag covering her, signifying the death of Nigeria. He accuses the Igbo man of killing Nigeria. While they're arguing, a Yoruba woman comes and sees them arguing and accuses them of killing Nigeria. Finally, an Efik man comes and tells them to stop fighting, that instead, they should bring their resources to save Nigeria.

Turns out, each of them has detergent, water, a bucket, and soap. When they carry the flag covering the dead Nigeria and wash it clean and place it back on the dead body, the dead woman named Nigeria rises up from the dead.

**Drama end.**

Sandy had decided to do her drama come drama time, and I was confused when the female actors of the drama ambushed me a few minutes before our presentation.

Nafisat, who always seemed to be angry at me, was the first to attack.

"You can't just tell us to change a drama that we have practiced," she said.

The other light-skinned lady added, "We'll be doing part 2 of the first drama we did that everyone enjoyed." She said it with a very normal expression. The other girls joined in on their displeasure of what I was doing.

Sandy stood quietly by the corner, watching everything unfold. She had set an ambush for me.

She walked up to me after Nafisat and the girls had calmed down and said, "We'll be doing part 2 of the first drama we did. They liked the first one; why wouldn't they like this one?"

She patted me twice on the shoulder and walked away with the girls.

"You better win, Sandy," I whispered to myself. This whole scenario had made me realize that Sandy and I thought differently. If we kept thinking differently like this, the social events would operate independently, and that would be terrible. That means she wouldn't listen to advice from me and would just want to act on her own. This was a classic age gap issue. The girls in drama liked Nigerian movies; I liked American. I am willing to meet in the middle, but would Sandy?

If we don't win this, I'd have to start thinking of removing her. Can I even do that? I'll have to find out.

We didn't win.

Sandy and the drama gang went out there and spent over 30 minutes on their drama. The rules for drama were simple:

1. You have 10 minutes.
2. No microphones—let your voice be loud.
3. Make sure your drama is in sync with the topic (Unity in Diversity).

Sandy and the gang went out there and used over 30 minutes acting out a Nigerian film (I knew we were out already), and throughout, I watched with a little bit of anger.

Platoon 9 got second place. They did some symbolism presentation with all the muscular people they had in their platoon. So just imagine like 10 muscular guys, dabbed in oil, shouting, "Eyimba, eyi!" and coming on stage. They caught the attention of the crowd as soon as they stepped in, while Platoon 6 refused to listen, and people kept chatting away while they were acting.

And yes, before I forget, as soon as I saw the entrance of the drama, I knew it was either Sophie or Victor that made this. And turns out, it was Sophie. I'll talk about Platoon 9's Puppet Platoon leader another time.
