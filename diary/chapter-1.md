# Chapter 1 - "Happy Valentines day sir"

My message to my father on February 14 is, "Happy Valentines day" was still unread on Whatsapp but it was beginning to have that typing text, meaning my father was reading it and replying.

I had sent him a text stating like Items I needed for my NYSC camp because I figured out my name (and come out the day before), my name wasn't supposed to come out and certainly not for Imo state.

See here are the rules and how these NYSC postings work, they send People from the north to the south, people from the south to the north, people from the east to the west and people from the west to the east. But right there on my allocation letter it boldly said Imo state. That means they moved me from portharcourt which was a south, to Imo state which still was a south, ain't no way Son, ain't no way.

Few weeks ago people had advised me to pay so I'd arrange the state I wanted, and I wanted to go to Lagos, I wanted to meet music people and maybe someone that would push my music career further but I didn't want to pay for it, my best friend's mother had paid for him but we (my mother and I) didn't leave it for God to decide where I go and right here, right here on my allocation letter it boldly said Imo state. That means they moved me from portharcourt which was a south, to Imo state which still was a south, ain't no way Son, ain't no way.

My father replies with "Use an excel sheet and give me details" and I'm shocked, he needs an excel sheet to send me money for NYSC?? damn. Damn, damn, damn.

We spent an hour going through the list and deleting things

"I'm yet to know the cost to travel to imo state, I'll inform you as soon as possible" I typed

He sent me the money for it after removing a few things from the list, he's really careful with money, but sometimes I think he's too careful.

He sent me the money and I began to make plans on how to purchase the items, all is well.
