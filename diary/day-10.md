# "Politics, Politics, Politics"

Today is Saturday and is kinda complicated, I've been scared to wash my uniform or my socks or anything at all because I don't want it to get stolen; but I'm running out of clean clothes and I've got to wash, I've made a small cloth hanger around my bed side but it can only dry my underwear and this lady gave me her laundry card that she does laundry; its going to cost me, but I've told you before, I'm a millionaire.

I took my clothes to her and she came to meet me at the parade ground to collect them, told me to call her on Monday.

Also queen of the night seems to be fond of me now, Queen of the night is a shop lady that's before Mami market, she was rude to me at first but I guess I'm a charming person so she talks nicely to me now and lets me take stuff without paying because she knows I'll pay, I never forget debts.

Now Queen of the night has a guy that assists her too, I'll call him "I have many powers" because he likes Odumeje a lot we joke about that "I have so many powers leplatuseplelamante" from time to time. By the side of their shop is the Cybercafe I told you about, all of them are really cool people.

Majeed told me that we may still have a chance to get back into the game, so I called miracle so we'd talk about it

"We might be best losers" miracle said

"In what sport"

"Football and volleyball" he replied

"Majeed, get the girls back in training, in case" I said

"No wahala" he replied as he ran away as he spotted a woman

The term "Best losers" is used for games where an uneven number of teams is selected for a qualifiers game, there are 10 platoons, 5 platoons qualified for both football and volleyball, but the fifth team will need to play with another team, that's where "Best losers come in", they get to play with the fifth team.

Sophie also introduced me to her friends, so here's all of them and their names

1. Mimi - She's the chubby cute girl that looked at me like she wanted to tear my clothes after the karaoke night.

2. Victoria - She was the girl that dressed up in Ankara for platoon 9

3. Victor - The white haired nigga that back flipped and had been doing avant-garde things with Sophie and one of the reasons platoon 9 had been winning anything at all.

4. Mary - She was always with victor, even I could see she liked him, she glanced at him like he was her saviour and yes Victor always had his arms around her shoulders the way bros hold each other, this nigga was playing hard to get.

5. Unicorn - You've heard of Unicorn before now, she's a very nice sweet person and smiles almost 100% of the time

Mrs Eneda called for me to tell me that our Man-o-war would be coming up soon, simply put man-o-war duties was nigga's doing soldier training activities like crawling under a thorn and running and a lot of other soldier training stuff, she also asked me to find our Mr Macho (I'll explain this later, or have I explained this?) and convince a lady to represent us for the BBB competition.

The state coordinator called for a meeting, she wanted to see the leaders of the corps, in short, the campus police, Platoon leaders, Hostel admins and one other stressful position I don't remember.

I found out Sandy was a married woman in the meeting (I'd been ordering around a married woman since, Jesus) and our state coordinator was kind of a nice woman too and now finally, the drama.

For the first time, I and sandy did not agree, she wanted to make our drama presentation tonight be some kind of Nigerian film kinda play, I hated the idea, the topic for the drama was Unity in diversity

I wanted to make a symbolic type of drama but Sandy said she had a drama already and I shouldn't worry

"Tell me about the drama" I told her

"Its about---" she started narrating

Even I was bored how were everyone else going to sit down for 10 minutes to listen to this boring stuff but I let it be

Drama night came and yeah, she did follow a few of the things I told her (I told her a few people should not enter the stage but come from the crowd) but to me it was a very poorly done drama, we were only saved by the fact that we had stars in the drama, the MC for every NYSC social night was a platoon 6 member and he was quite popular, Sandy was a Platoon 6 member and she was a little popular, the parade commander for our NYSC parade/ Flag bearer (Before he was replaced with a girl) was a platoon 6 member. And these people had roles in the drama, as far as I'm concerned that's what saved us and we qualified!

Platoon 9 also qualified but I noticed that their energy wasn't there anymore, Victor was probably weakened from his disqualification from the cultural dance last night and Sophie was too angry to care much, as far as I'm concerned their platoon leader is a puppet platoon leader, he's a nice guy no lie, but the people actually making their platoon win anything was the duo, Victor X Sophie.

I wasn't happy with the fact that we just managed to qualify due to the amount of stars in our drama, and the drama finals is tomorrow so I'm not sure its going to save us if we don't actually make a good drama.

I have an idea for what we can present in the drama finals but it means I'm going to clash with Sandy as it seems she likes to make Nollywood type stuff and my next plan is Symbolism.

I want our platoon to win, so the clash is inevitable.
