# The swearing in parade

I woke up by 3am, had to tap all my bedmates to get up and went to have a bath, and started putting on my clothes, the soldiers came and started blowing their trumpets and as people started waking up, I was heading to parade.

I forgot to tell ya the commandant came yesterday and told us not to fuck with him lol. HE was a short man with an army uniform but had tons of power and he wanted to prove it to us. While he was talking and introducing himself the platoons were making noise, I tried to get my members to keep it down but they didn't and in a show of power he says

"okay, all of you lie down"

"Dapo, anyone you see not lying down bring them to me" he added

And in a few minutes over 1000 people were lying down on the ground

"I told you people not to play with me"

"i'm talking and you are making noise" he said while coming down from the pavillion

I fear short men with power, they will brutalize you

"we need to have an agreement here, if I let you stand up, you will keep quiet ba?" The crowd echoed "yes"

"and if you make noise I will have all of you roll on the floor"

"Dapo this people are joking with me" he said

"Alright, if I say, where is salamatu what does it mean" he asked

There was dead silence

A dude raised his hand from the back

"yes, let that man speak" "stand up"

The nigga stood

"what does it mean"

"it means run" he replies

"see someone that lived with military folks hahaha"

All of us joined to laugh because we didn't want this man to tell us to roll with our white and white in this red sand

"When I tell you to go, you better march well tomorrow and don't embarrass me in front of the state coordinator"

"where is Salamatu" he said

And with that all of us got up and ran out like mad people.

The day was finally here and at the devotion we met the state cordinator, she was a short woman that had a big smile but her aura told me she could change shit up quickly if she wanted to.

She thanked us for being good kids and promised to give us chicken for our obedience thus far and then she started calling names. I stood with my platoon and looked around in confusion, what were the names for, what if it was for punishment then I hear

"Sophie mamodu, 1229"

Sophie comes out, I was scared, what if its for people that wanted to relocate

When the last name was called the lady moved to their side and said with a smile

"do you know why I called them here today"

The crowd echoed "no"

"from when we started camp till now, their birthdays happened in this camp"

She said with a smile

"band, can I get a happy birthday song so the celebrants can dance?" she said as she turned to the direction of the band

With that the band played happy birthday tune and we sang along while Sophie and the other celebrants danced.

As soon as the whole ordeal was over I knew what next was the swearing in, I finally rendezvoused with Sophie and Unicorn and she seemed happy today.

Everyone around me was taking photos but I just watched them, my family doesn't do cringe love, they hardly even tell me congratulations, if they do it won't come from the heart so I found no reason to take pictures and just sat in the dining watching Sophie and Unicorn take photos.

And I had blacked out from reality and was brought back by the click sound of a camera, Sophie had taken my picture

She turns and shows the picture to me

"you look good Mr Isaac"

"sure" I said with a smirk

"Aren't you going to show off your NYSC uniform?" she asked

"i don't have any reason to do that"

"your people would like to see it tho"

"i doubt that' I replied while I stretched my hand to take the phone from her so I could delete the photos

"i like to see you in it, why won't they?" she replied after retreating backwards so I couldn't snatch the phone and the sun rose in that moment making her shine before me, accompanied with the smile and the strong gaze we maintained, I had no idea when I smiled back, millionaire or not, my life was shit, but this lady made me happy

"why didn't you tell me its your birthday" I said while still maintaining the gaze

" I didn't think it was important " she replied and stopped doing anything and just stared at me.

I took out a black bag and gave her an apple, she smiled and took a bite just before the army man blew the trumpet for us to go to the parade,

I was scared about it all, how long we would stand, how long we would need water but her by my side was just enough for me to go through the day.

The standing was long, a few times I, Unicorn and Sophie would run to sit in the back so we can stop standing then Soldier Dapo would come running with cane and anyone who sat there would run away like mosquitos, but after a long day of marching, we stood said the swearing in oath and as it was done, threw our caps up followed by a lot of cheers, Sophie was excited but I stood there amazed by how everyone was so happy in their lives, they had families to send photos to, families that would actually care

She turned to me and said

"Corper 1066, how are you" and adjusted my cap

There were 900 people in the parade ground, running and hugging each other, but she was all I could see and in that moment, I thought, I want to have my own family, one where love is important above all else one where someone could look at me like I was important to them and I would return the favor, one where I was somebodies family and all these thoughts came running through while she fiddled with my cap while maintaining eye contact, it was 5:30pm, the red dusts were around us like fog from the running of excited Corpers, our eyes locked on each other, what tf is wrong with me, right then my heart was beating as If the drum squad was playing the national anthem in there then I went for a hug and once I was in her arms I felt peace and we hugged tightly, I don't know for how long. What tf is going on with me.

After dinner we were to have a welcoming party at the main hall, I knew what was up, the competitions had begun and I had a few cards to play.

I sat with Sophie behind and they did a lot of boring stuff, but the one interesting thing they did was tell a dance battle

I forgot to add, the judges were boring old people truly, they said

1. No Twerking
2. No Stunts
3. No nudity

I was turned off by this. They started a dancing competition and asked all the platoons to produce contestants (No one came from platoon 6) and this girl from platoon 5 I think started twerking and bro, her ass shook like water, I had to gain composure to look away, I was no longer just some random dude anymore, how I behaved was going to reflect my platoon. Sophie was on snap-chat shooting a video of the dance competition, One of the lady judges told the twerking girl to stop and then she stopped.

After that they did a singing competition and I was able to find a singer in Platoon 6, remember the smiling girl from the first day, the one that asked me to keep her files, she ended up in platoon 6, her name is queen and she can sing, so after searching through the crowd for any platoon 6 member that could sing, I found her and boy can she sing, when she started singing everybody kept quiet

"That's a diamond right there" I said

Sophie gave me a confused look

"huh?"

"nothing, I'm just soliloquizing" I reply

At lights out we bade ourselves good night, girls went to girls hostel and boys were asked to stay back and arrange the chairs.

I retreated to my hostel tired asf but from the next day I knew what was up, The inter platoon games had began.

Gtg. I'm tired
