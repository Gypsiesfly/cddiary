# Day 4 - A Typical Sunday

Sunday was a day of doing nothing till evening that's like 5pm.

Today was my day of planning. I had only one of my platoon members in the hostel and on the other hand I haven't told you a lot about the hostel.

I have a bedmate under me, remember I took the up bunk, he was a chill guy, I kept my bucket of water under his bed so in case anyone tried to take it he'd wake up and stop them.

By my left was a bunk with two Yoruba guys, the truth is the Yoruba folks on twitter have given me a bad vibe about Yoruba people in general, from my findings on twitter, I find them to be violent, cunning and deceitful. But most importantly violent.

And I was also pissed with them for voting in the current president over tribalism than works, they'd bring up "he improved lagos" but bro look at lagos, it legit smells, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT the Nigerian situation anymore, I'm writing a diary not a country prison manual.

Anyways turns out the guys were cool dudes, the yoruba guy on the top bunk was dark and wore black medicated lens he looked nerdy but looked like a guy that could do some real damage if he put his mind into it, his down bad bunkmate on the other hand was a funny guy, I think he has a girlfriend because he's always on a call every time we get into the hostel telling her "I love you" and what not, we used to take turns to make fun of him but I was a little jealous of him tho, he's got someone who loves him.

Now, the end of the room is the bunk of the platoon leader of Platoon 4 he acts like he's dumb which is another reason why I think he's smart.

Well Sunday mornings were to wash and so on, no 5am morning parade devotions or marching, just go about your day, I also had to come up with a way to wash my clothes without spreading them outside because I know they'd steal people's stuff and I didn't want my stuff to disappear, I think I'll wash my underwear myself and pay for other things to be washed.

I also decided not to go to church and yeah they said Sundays are the only days we're allowed to wear other clothes that are not white on white, that means you can dress how you want on Sundays from morning till evening but once its parade time put on your white and white with your NYSC cap.

I texted Sophie if she wants to meet up, she said no that her stomach was hurting her so I arranged my box and slept off.

We finally met up at the parade but rather than staying at the back with me this time, she decided she wanted to join the front row for the marching, remember, the front row is for people that can stand for a long time as, you'll stand for a long asf time.

I spent time with my platoon members organizing stuff. From college I had a nice course rep, he had a way of organizing stuff and I wanted to follow after his footsteps so I started plan TRIDENT.

## Plan TRIDENT
A plan to make the platoon more successful:

1. **Create 2 WhatsApp groups**: 
   - One where the whole platoon can chat comfortably 
   - Another for just me communicating to the whole platoon 
   - NOTE: platoon group 1 can have all the officials, man o' war and the army lady, but group 2 has to be for only the Corpers. And also remember all the members have to be added by hand, they'd have to scan the WhatsApp QR code of the WhatsApp group to join.

2. **Create a hierarchy of power**, so information can pass comfortably.

3. **Know as many platoon 6 members and their strengths** and rank them from Diamond, Gold, Silver, and Bronze and know how to assign tasks to them.

### Ranking System:
- **Diamonds**: People who have exceptional skills, can motivate other people to work with them and have small to almost no flaws.
- **Golds**: People with exceptional skills but can only work alone.
- **Silvers**: People with exceptional skills but too many terms or a very significant flaw.
- **Bronzes**: Normal folks.

So I had a meeting with the rest of the platoon directors and I had learnt a few of their names:
- Social director: Sandy
- Sports director: Miracle
- Debate director: [Name forgotten]
- Kitchen director: [Name forgotten]

We laid out some plans and I made sure all of them picked out their contestants for all the competitions coming at us. Trust me, these positions are stripped down to smaller roles so the Bronzes are actually very important.

## Evening Events
Later that evening (it was dark like 7pm) I bought an apple for Sophie because I didn't like the fact that she was getting sick already (it's just the 3rd day) and she was having stomach pain and it was making the smiles fade from her face and I didn't want that. So...I decided I was going to give her apples everyday so she doesn't have to leave camp due to sickness because, maybe, I enjoy her company.

Then she dropped a bomb while we were waiting for our food at the kiosk:

"I plan to relocate," she said while looking straight at me.

I felt my throat go dry.

"Why?" I replied.

"Because I miss home, it's so far from here, and all my life is there, what do I know here?" she said while chucking a spoon of her food into her mouth.

I put a spoon of the food in my mouth and pretended not to care but I wondered who I'd do anything with if she left.

Later that night we went for the "NYSC movie" - it's simply these guys playing the history of the NYSC program on TV.

Then we bade ourselves goodnight.

So goodnight to you too readers, tomorrow the battle continues and yeah it's lights out. Gotta go.
