# A Typical Sunday

Sunday was a day of doing nothing till evening that's like 5pm.

Today was my day of planning. I had only one of my platoon members in the hostel and on the other hand I haven't told you a lot about the hostel.

I have a bedmate under me, remember I took the up bunk, he was a chill guy, I kept my bucket of water under his bed so in case anyone tried to take it he'd wake up and stop them.

By my left was a bunk with two Yoruba guys, the truth is the Yoruba folks on twitter have given me a bad vibe about Yoruba people in general, from my findings on twitter, I find them to be violent, cunning and deceitful. But most importantly violent.

And I was also pissed with them for voting in the current president over tribalism than works, they'd bring up "he improved lagos" but bro look at lagos, it legit smells, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT the Nigerian situation anymore, I'm writing a diary not a country prison manual.

Anyways turns out the guys were cool dudes, the yoruba guy on the top bunk was dark and wore black medicated lens he looked nerdy but looked like a guy that could do some real damage if he put his mind into it, his down bad bunkmate on the other hand was a funny guy, I think he has a girlfriend because he's always on a call every time we get into the hostel telling her "I love you" and what not, we used to take turns to make fun of him but I was a little jealous of him tho, he's got someone who loves him.

Now, the end of the room is the bunk of the platoon leader of Platoon 4 he acts like he's dumb which is another reason why I think he's smart.
Well Sunday mornings were to wash and so on, no
5am morning parade devotions or marching, just go
about your day, I also had to come up with a way to
wash my clothes without spreading them outside
because I know they’d steal people’s stuff and I didn’t
want my stuff to disappear, I think I’ll wash my
underwear myself and pay for other things to be
washed. I also decided not to go to church and yeah they said
Sundays are the only days we’re allowed to wear other
clothes that are not white on white, that means you
can dress how you want on Sundays from morning till
evening but once its parade time put on your white
and white with your NYSC cap
I texted Sophie if she wants to meet up, she said no
that her stomach was hurting her so I arranged my
box and slept off
We finally met up at the parade but rather than
staying at the back with me this time, she decided she
wanted to join the front row for the marching, remember, the front row is for people that can stand
for a long time as, you’ll stand for a long asf time. I spent time with my platoon members organizing
stuff. From college I had a nice course rep, he had a
way of organizing stuff and I wanted to follow after
his footsteps so I started plan TRIDENT
A plan to make the platoon more successful
1. Create 2 whatsapp groups: one for where the whole
platoon can chat comfortably and the other for just
me communicating to the whole platoon and NOTE:
platoon group 1 can have all the officials, man o war
and the army lady , but group 2 has to be for only
the Corpers. And also remember all the members have
to be added by hand, theyd have to scan the
whatsapp QR code of the whatsapp group to join
2. Create a heirarchy of power , so information can
pass comfortably
3. Know as many platoon 6 members and their
strengths and rank them From Diamond, Gold, silver
and bronze and know how to assign tasks to them, here’s how it works
Diamonds: are people who have exceptional skills, can
motivate other people to work with them and have
small to almost no flaws
Golds: people with exceptional skills but can only work
alone
Silvers: people with exceptional skills but too many
terms or a very significant flaw
Bronzes: normal folks
So I had a meeting with the rest of the platoon
directors and I had learnt a few of their names
Social director: Sandy
Sports director: Miracle
Debate director: ive forgotten his name
Kitchen director: I’ve forgotten her name
We laid out some plans and I made sure all of them
picked out their contestants for all the competitions
coming at us, trust me these positions are stripped
down to smaller roles so the Bronzes are actually very
important.
Later that evening (it was dark like 7pm) I bought an
apple for Sophie because I didn’t like the fact that
she was getting sick already (its just the 3
rd day) and
she was having stomach pain and it was making the
smiles fade from her face and I didn’t want that
so…I decided I was going to give her apples everyday
so she doesn’t have to leave camp due to sickness
because, maybe, I enjoy her company, then she
dropped a bomb while we were waiting for our food at
the kiosk
“i plan to relocate” she said while looking straight at
me
I felt my throat go dry
“why” I replied
“because I miss home, its so far from here, and all my
life is there, what do I know here” she said while
chucking a spoon of her food into her mouth
I put a spoon of the food in my mouth and
pretended not to care but I wondered who I’d do
anything with if she left. Later that night we went for the “NYSC movie” its
simply these niggas playing the history of the NYSC
programe on TV
Then we bade ourselves goodnight. So goodnight to you too readers, tomorrow the batte
continues and yeah its lights out gotta go.
