# Day 3 - Platoon leader

Now here's the thing, after collecting your NYSC
uniform and registering, you are officially a corper so
you have to go to the parade….but, you can also not
go by hiding your NYSC ID and pretending that
you've not done registration, the parade is a practice
for the swearing in of Corpers, I wouldn't have gone
but, something told me to go and most importantly, I
was going to see Sophie, so I decided to go.

And please, I see Sophie as a friend that makes me
happy, don't misunderstand it.

So we met up in the parade ground and talked for a
while and took photo's together before we were told
to form up according to platoons, she was in platoon
9 and I was in platoon 6 so we had to go our separate
ways

So the platoon gathering had begun, see here's how it
works, you shout the number of your platoon while
walking around till you meet another person that's
shouting the same platoon number and then both of
you meet another set of folks shouting the platoonnumber and then you form up; that's how you gather
your platoon in a crowd of 1 million people.

My platoon had a lot of interesting people, we were a
lot, id say like 150 people but there were a few people
of note
1. A really tall huge dude that looked scary
2. A really huge dude that had a potbelly and looked
scary still
3. A light skinned tall guy that just smiled a lot
4. A big woman that had a lot of energy and talked
too much
5. And a really slender tall girl that stood out, I don't
know if it was because of her hair, how they fell from
her head down to her waist or how they just fit her
entire frame, in summary, she looked good, even from
afar

These people stood out to me.

I forgot to add, before the gathering, while I was with
Sophie, we practised marching with the officials, the
people who could stand for long periods of time would
stay in the front, but those who couldn't had to stay
in the back,, I and Sophie stayed in the back.

There was this really tall army man, that kept saying
"if you play with me, I will murder you!"
"i will eat your heart!" stuff like that, it was really
funny to me.So back to the crowd, while we were formed up the
assistant head of the NYSC for Imo state/ assistant
state coordinator addressed us and told us that it
was time to select officials, each platoon was to have
one army official, one man-o-war and a platoon
officer (I've already met her, remember the lady from
registration) and all platoon officers should begin
selection.

"form a circle" said my platoon officer
she was a short woman but like I said , you could
sense she could pull strings

I ended up at the front line of the circle and the
army lady started the election

The posts available were
1. Director of sports
2. Director of debate
3. Director of socials
4. Director of Kitchen
5. Assistant Platoon Leader
6. Platoon leader

I'll explain all their posts soon enough when I have
time, I'm a little sleepy rn, so I can't write for long
and its 10pm and these niggas are calling for lights
out so I'll make this as short as possible.

The Director of sports went to a bearded guy that
looked like he cared about nothing in the world.
Debate director went to some small guy that had 1 st
class, my platoon officer legit asked all thecontestants for Director of debate their CGPA and
turns out only the short guy had a 1 st class so he got
it.
Director of socials went to (the big woman that had
energy)
Director of kitchen went to some dark-skinned lady
And now…Platoon leader

The platoon leader post election was more serious
than the rest, the army lady asked all the
contestants to step out and remember, I was in the
front-line so she asked
"are you contesting?"
"no" I replied and proceeded to push back into the
line

She looked around and when she saw it was only
women that came to contest for platoon leader she
made one disgusted look at all the men
"so you are telling me there is no male that wants to
contest" she said while looking and searching for fit
men with her eyes

The big dudes at the back started hiding and when
she pointed any guy he'd either duck or shake his
head to say no

While all this was going on, I was just thinking.
I know I came to camp to heal, to just pass time and
go back home refreshed… but that's not who I want
to be, back in primary school I was a tyrant, in
secondary school a terrorist, in college I was a nerd,only books and anime, didn't have any real friends
till my 2 nd or 3 rd year BUT THEN IT HIT ME.
NO ONE HERE KNOWS ME, I looked around and
nobody here had ever seen my face before, I had
never seen any of these niggas before, for all they
know I can be some prophet if I pretend to be one, I
can be some cool guy if I pretend to be one and I can
be anything, before I could even arrange my thoughts,
MY LEGS MOVED, MOVED STRAIGHT INTO THE INNER
CIRCLE, WHERE THE PLATOON LEADER VOTES WERE
HAPPENING.

The army woman looked at me and said
"i thought you say you no dey contest" hissed and
continued
"una dey confused eh" she added

So it was me VS 5 girls

The voting started by signaling of hands
If the army lady raises your hand up and asks
"do you want to vote for "So so and so"
The amount of hands raised counts as the votes.

The truth is, now that I'm settled, when I think about
why I went out, it was just to make the competition
more competitive, to sweeten the pot, try my luck
maybe. but lo and behold when this army woman
raised my hands up
"If you know you want--"

She turns looks at me and asks "wetin be your name
again"
"Isaac" I replied

"if you know you want to vote Isaaczacky for platoon
leader" why she mispronounced my name, idk
"raise your hand" she added

Bruh, all hands in the circle were raised!
I kept a straight face but bruh, no way.

I was officially a platoon leader
The platoon officer took our names and phone
numbers
The I "I will murder you" soldier came and asked for
the platoon leader and the crowd pointed at me,
when he saw me he said
"Lekpa" he called the big guy that I told said stood
out to me
And walked away.

I was scared that maybe that big dude would be
forced to be platoon leader, because the guy
definitely did not want the position.

After a while the assistant state coordinator, I'm
going to call him ASC from now on. told everyone to
Form up and after we did he started calling names

And I heard my name and I had to walk out to the
front of the pavilion and faced the crowd, I was a
little scared about why my name was called until I
realized that there were 9 other guys with me and my
guess…THEY WERE ALL PLATOON LEADERS LIKE ME.

The man gave us blue arm bands apparently there are
3 types of arm bands
1. Blue arm bands for Platoon Leaders
2. Yellow arm bands for Police (I'll talk about these
dudes real soon)
3. Green arm bands for…I don't even know who those
niggas are, I'll find out tomorrow

So we were made to line up Platoon 1 leader to
Platoon 10.

The man took pictures while handing out the blue
bands but as soon as he got to me, I zoned out
because he said a single word
"congratulations"

This isn't a word I've heard a lot, I may have heard it
a couple of times with concept of some intent:
Maybe from my father when I finished ss3
Or him calling me "graduate" after my last college
exams but its not a word I'm used to

I haven't been told this a lot, the last person that did
was the girl I had a situation-ship with, she bought
wine when I had my first 1k streams on a song and I
was shocked because a woman had never done that
for me before and before that it was the head of the
competition I won, Farza telling me "congratulations
Ikannnnn" on stream.

But this one had me speechless, I didn't know what to
say, I'm not used to congratulations.

"you don't know how to say thank you??" the ASC
said
"Thank you sir" I said while bowing as a sign of both
respect and sorritude…is this even a word? Sorritude?
Just me apologizing goddammit.

All the "camp leaders" as they called us stood out
there and took a group photo afterwards we were sent
back.

Sophie saw me after the parade with the blue platoon
leader band and called me "Platoon leader" she was
cute when she smiled and it made me smile back.

"I'm hungry" she said
"Lets got to Mami market" she added
"do you want to come?"
"Yeah" I said

And we walked side by side talking about our
respective platoons.

But in my mind, I knew the games were starting, the
platoon was my army and I'd have to prepare them
for what was coming.

My platoon officer told me that they'd be
competitions, some with real prize money involved,
real consequences for failure and would need real
strategies.

"Lets get it" I soliloquized under my breath
"what did you say?" said Sophie as she turned
towards me, her eyes sparkling and on her face a
wide smile

"nothing" I replied, because even if Sophie is my
friend, I'm still going to be competing against her
platoon so I can't talk about my plans to her (she's in
platoon 9, I'm the leader of platoon 6)

We kept talking as we walked deeper into the market
in search of what to eat.
